Marijuana,https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-marijuana/art-20364974,Marijuana,Other Supplement,"Cannabis, also called weed or marijuana, is made from the dried leaves and buds of the Cannabis sativa plant.  Other names for cannabis include pot or dope. But the preferred name is cannabis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, also called the FDA, hasn't approved the use of the cannabis plant as medicine. But many states have made it legal to use cannabis. People sometimes use cannabis to treat health conditions. This is known as medical cannabis, also called medical marijuana. Cannabis contains chemicals called cannabinoids, which are the active compounds. There are more than 100 active compounds in cannabis. The most common cannabinoids are delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, also called THC, and cannabidiol, also called CBD. The THC in cannabis may change how a person thinks and feels. This change is known as a psychoactive effect. There are many other minor cannabinoids found in the plant that are being studied for medical use. The FDA has approved three medicines that have chemicals found in cannabis. These medicines include dronabinol (Marinol) and nabilone (Cesamet). Healthcare professionals may prescribe them to help people with serious nausea and vomiting caused by medicines used to treat cancer, called chemotherapy.  Some people with medical conditions that cause low appetite may take dronabinol to help them feel hungry. The FDA also has approved a purified liquid form of cannabidiol (Epidiolex). Cannabidiol, also called CBD, is a chemical found in cannabis. Healthcare professionals prescribe this medicine to treat rare conditions that cause seizures in children, such as Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome. Medical cannabis can be taken in many ways. It can be inhaled, taken by mouth as an edible or tincture, placed on the skin, or applied in a skin patch, also called transdermal.

It's also called retinol or retinoic acid. Vitamin A has antioxidant properties. Antioxidants are substances that might protect cells against the effects of free radicals. Free radicals are molecules made from reactions in the body or when the body is exposed to tobacco smoke or radiation. Free radicals might play a role in heart disease, cancer and other conditions. Vitamin A is found in many foods, such as spinach, eggs, dairy products, and yellow and orange vegetables. Vitamin A also is added to some foods, such as milk, margarine and cereals. Colorful fruits and vegetables, such as carrots and cantaloupe, are high in beta-carotene. The body changes beta-carotene into vitamin A. Taking too many vitamin A supplements can be harmful. Most people who eat a variety of food don't need to take vitamin A supplements. Those who don't have a lot of access to a variety of fresh foods or food from animals, such as people living in lower income countries, may take vitamin A supplements. People with some conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, or people who are pregnant may not get enough vitamin A, also called vitamin A deficiency. They may need to take vitamin A supplements. People with conditions that keep them from absorbing nutrients, such as Crohn's or celiac disease, also may need to take vitamin A supplements. If you take vitamin A for its antioxidant properties, keep in mind that the supplement might not offer the same benefits as vitamins found naturally in foods.

And it's in fish such as salmon, mackerel, and sardines. The body also makes vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin. How much vitamin D the body makes depends on many things. These include the time of day you're in the sun, what season it is, where you live, and the color of your skin. Depending on where you live and your lifestyle, you might get little to no vitamin D from the sun during winter. Although you need sunscreen to prevent skin cancer, using it also can lessen how much vitamin D your body makes. Many older adults don't get enough direct sunlight.
