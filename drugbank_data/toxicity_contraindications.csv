In cases of overdose with oral cyclosporine, forced emesis and gastric lavage are recommended 2 hours after ingestion. There are little data available in the literature regarding overdoses with cyclosporine, but hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity may occur.[L3734] One case report of an cyclosporine overdose due to medical error was made involving a 26 year old female and noted the occurrence of nausea, flushing, tremor, vertigo and vomiting, which resolved within about 1 day. Anorexia and a feeling of increased body girth were also experienced by this patient and resolved within about 2 weeks.[A189453] When overdose with cyclosporine is observed, it is important to consider that dialysis and charcoal, hemoperfusion are not effective techniques to remove cyclosporine from the body.[L3734]

","Cyclosporine is approved for a variety of conditions. Firstly, it is approved for the prophylaxis of organ rejection in allogeneic kidney, liver, and heart transplants. It is also used to prevent bone marrow transplant rejection. For the above indications, cyclosporine can be used in conjunction with azathioprine and corticosteroids.

**General toxicity**

Vitamin B12 is generally non-toxic, even at higher doses. Mild, transient diarrhea, polycythemia vera, peripheral vascular thrombosis, itching, transitory exanthema, a feeling of swelling of entire body, pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure in early treatment stages, anaphylactic shock and death have been observed after vitamin B12 administration [F3736].

**Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis**

Long term studies in animals examining the carcinogenic potential of any of the vitamin B12 formulations have not completed to date.  There is no evidence from long-term use in patients with pernicious anemia that vitamin B12 has carcinogenic potential. Pernicious
anemia is known to be associated with an increased incidence of stomach carcinoma, however, this malignancy has been attributed to the underlying cause of pernicious anemia and has not been found to be related to treatment with vitamin B12 [FDA label].

**Use in pregnancy**

 No adverse effects have been reported with ingestion of normal daily requirements during pregnancy [F3736]. 

**A note on the use of the nasal spray in pregnancy**

Although vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin and requirements are increased during pregnancy, it is currently unknown whether the nasal spray form can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. The nasal spray form should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed, as it is considered a pregnancy category C drug in this form. Sufficient well-controlled studies have not been done to this date in pregnant women [FDA label].

**Use in lactation**

Vitamin B12 has been found distributed into the milk of nursing women in concentrations similar to the maternal blood vitamin B12 concentrations. No adverse effects have been reported to date with intake of normal required doses during lactation [F3736].
","
**Nasal spray**

The cyanocobalamin nasal spray is indicated for the maintenance of vitamin B12 concentrations after normalization with intramuscular vitamin B12 therapy in patients with deficiency of this vitamin who have no nervous system involvement [FDA label].

Note:  CaloMist [FDA label], the nasal spray form, has not been evaluated for the treatment of newly diagnosed vitamin B12 deficiency.

**Injection forms (subcutaneous, intramuscular)**

These forms are indicated for vitamin B12 deficiencies due to various causes, with or without neurologic manifestations [F3736].  Vitamin B12 deficiency is frequently caused by malabsorption, which is often associated with the following conditions [L5545]:

Addisonian (pernicious) anemia

Gastrointestinal pathology, dysfunction, or surgery, including gluten enteropathy or sprue, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, total or partial gastrectomy

Fish tapeworm infestation

Malignancy of the pancreas or bowel

Folic acid deficiency


**Oral forms**

Vitamin B12 supplements are widely available and indicated in patients who require supplementation for various reasons.  Dose requirements for vitamin B12 which are higher than normal (caused by pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis, hemolytic anemia, hemorrhage, malignancy, hepatic and renal disease) can usually be achieved with oral supplementation [L5545].   Oral products of vitamin B12 are not recommended in patients with malabsorption, as these forms are primarily absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract [F3739]. "

Fluconazole overdoses have been associated with hallucination and paranoia, sometimes in combination.[L11043] In cases of overdose, employ supportive treatment. Gastric lavage may be necessary.[L11043] Other modalities such as forced diuresis or hemodialysis may also be used.[L11043]

**A note on liver toxicity**

The FDA label warns that this drug carries a risk of hepatotoxicity. Rare but serious cases of serious hepatic toxicity have been reported, especially in patients with serious underlying medical conditions using fluconazole.  This group of patients has an increased risk of fatality when using fluconazole.[L11043]  In patients with existing liver dysfunction, use caution during fluconazole therapy. Those who are found to have abnormal liver function tests during therapy should be carefully monitored for the development of increasingly severe injury to the liver. Fluconazole should be stopped if its use is likely to be the underlying cause of liver injury, and medical attention should be sought.[L11043,L6505] Fluconazole induced hepatotoxicity is usually reversible.[L11043]

**Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, and impairment of fertility**

Fluconazole demonstrated no evidence of carcinogenic risk in mice and rats treated orally for 24 months at doses equivalent to approximately 2-7 time the recommended human dose). Male rats given fluconazole at doses equivalent to supratherapeutic human doses showed an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas. Cytogenetic studies in vivo and in vitro demonstrated no sign of chromosomal mutation. The significance of these findings for humans is unknown.[L11043]

**Use in pregnancy**

There are no sufficient and well-controlled studies of fluconazole use in pregnant women. Available human data do not show an increased risk of congenital anomalies after pregnant women were treated with standard doses (<200 mg/day) of fluconazole, either in a single dose or multiple doses in the first trimester did not appear to impact the fetus negatively.[L11043] Several case reports describe rare but striking congenital anomalies observed in infants who were exposed to fluconazole at high doses reaching 400-800 mg/day, primarily in the first trimester of pregnancy. Similar findings were observed in animal studies. If this drug is administered during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking fluconazole, the risk should be discussed thoroughly.[L11043]

**Use in nursing**

Fluconazole is secreted in breastmilk at high concentrations. Exercise caution if this drug is used during nursing.[L11043]","Fluconazole can be administered in the treatment of the following fungal infections[L11043]:

 1) Vaginal yeast infections caused by Candida
 2) Systemic Candida infections

 6) Peritonitis (inflammation of the peritoneum) caused by Candida

**A note on fungal infection prophylaxis**

Patients receiving bone marrow transplantation who are treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy may be predisposed to candida infections, and may receive fluconazole as prophylactic therapy.[L11043]

**A note on laboratory testing**

Obtaining specimens for fungal culture and other important laboratory studies such as serology or pathology is advised before starting fluconazole therapy in order to isolate the organisms to be eliminated through treatment. It is permissible to start therapy before the results are available, however, adjusting the therapy once laboratory results confirm the causative organism may be necessary.[L11043]

Symptoms of overdose may include diarrhea, nausea, stomach cramps, and vomiting. Erythromycin should immediately be discontinued in cases of overdose. Rapid elimination of unabsorbed drug should be attempted. Supportive measures should be initiated. Erythromycin is not adequately removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis.[L7261]

","
Erythromycin is indicated in the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of various bacteria.[L7261] The indications for erythromycin have been summarized by body system below:

**Respiratory infections**

Mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with appropriate doses of sulfonamides) can be treated with erythromycin.[L7261] Mild to moderate lower-respiratory tract infections due to susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes may also be treated. Erythromycin treats listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]
Erythromycin is indicated to treat pertussis (whooping cough) caused by Bordetella pertussis. It is effective in eliminating the causative organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals, rendering them noninfectious. Clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may aid in the prevention of pertussis infection for individuals who have been exposed to the bacteria.[L7261] Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae may also be treated with erythromycin.[L7261]  Despite the fact that no controlled clinical efficacy studies have been conducted to this date, in vitro and certain preliminary clinical study results indicate that erythromycin may be an effective treatment in  Legionnaires’ Disease.[L7261] Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat diphtheria and other infections due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, as an adjunct to antitoxin, to prevent carrier status and to eradicate the organism in existing carriers.[L7261] In addition to the prevention of diphtheria, erythromycin can be used to prevent rheumatic fever in penicillin intolerant patients.[L7261]
 

**Skin infections**

Mild to moderate skin or skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus may be treated with erythromycin, however, resistant staphylococcal organisms may emerge.[L7261] Erythromycin can also be used to treat erythrasma, an infectious condition caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum.[L7261]


**Gastrointestinal infections**

Intestinal amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica can be treated with oral erythromycin. Extraenteric amebiasis warrants treatment with other antimicrobial drugs.[L7261]


**Genital infections/STIs**

Erythromycin can be used as an alternative drug in treating acute pelvic inflammatory disease caused by N. gonorrheae in female patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity or intolerance to penicillin.[L7261] Syphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum, can be treated with erythromycin.  It serves as an alternative treatment for primary syphilis in patients who have demonstrated penicillin hypersensitivity. Erythromycin can also be used in the primary stage of primary syphilis.[L7261] Another approved indication of erythromycin is to treat chlamydial infections that cause conjunctivitis of the newborn, pneumonia of infancy, and urogenital infections occurring in pregnancy. It is indicated as an alternative option to tetracyclines for the treatment of uncomplicated rectal, urethral and endocervical infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis.[L7261] Erythromycin can be used in nongonococcal urethritis can be used when tetracyclines cannot be administered. Finally, erythromycin is indicated to treat nongonococcal urethritis due to Ureaplasma urealyticum.[L7261]

DB00201,"The oral LD50 of caffeine in rats is 192 mg/kg.[MSDS] An acute fatal overdose of caffeine in humans is about 10–14 grams (equivalent to 150–200 mg/kg of body weight).[T722]

**Caffeine overdose**

In the case of caffeine overdose, seizures may occur, as caffeine is a central nervous system stimulant. It should be used with extreme caution in those with epilepsy or other seizure disorders.[L9851] Symptoms of overdose may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal upset. Intoxication with caffeine is included in the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10).  Agitation, anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, tachycardia, tremors, tachycardia, psychomotor agitation, and, in some cases, death can occur, depending on the amount of caffeine consumed.  Overdose is more likely to occur in individuals who do not consume caffeine regularly but consume energy drinks.[A187721]

**Overdose management**

For a mild caffeine overdose, offer symptomatic treatment. In the case of a severe overdose, intubation for airway protection from changes in mental status or vomiting may be needed. Activated charcoal and hemodialysis can prevent further complications of an overdose and prevent absorption and metabolism. Benzodiazepine drugs can be administered to prevent or treat seizures.  IV fluids and vasopressors may be necessary to combat hypotension associated with caffeine overdose. In addition, magnesium and beta blocking drugs can be used to treat arrhythmias that may occur, with defibrillation and resuscitation if the arrhythmias are lethal. Follow local ACLS protocols.[T716]","Caffeine is indicated for the short term treatment of apnea of prematurity in infants and off label for the prevention and treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia caused by premature birth.[T716,L9851] In addition, it is indicated in combination with sodium benzoate to treat respiratory depression resulting from an overdose with CNS depressant drugs.[L9899] Caffeine has a broad range of over the counter uses, and is found in energy supplements, athletic enhancement products, pain relief products, as well as cosmetic products.[T716,L9854,L9872]"
DB00202,"Overdosage of succinylcholine is likely to extend the neuromuscular blockade beyond the time needed for surgery. Symptoms are likely to be consistent with its therapeutic effects, although more pronounced, and may therefore include skeletal muscle weakness, decreased respiratory reserve, low tidal volume, or apnea. Treatment of succinylcholine overdose involves airway and respiratory support until recovery of normal respiration is assured.[L9004]

Depending on the extent of the overdose, the characteristic depolarizing (i.e. Phase I) neuromuscular blockade may switch to resemble more closely a non-depolarizing (i.e. Phase II) neuromuscular blockade.[L9004] This occurs primarily when succinylcholine is given over a prolonged period of time or with particularly large doses, and may result in significant respiratory muscle paralysis or weakness.","Succinylcholine is indicated as an adjunct to general anesthesia, to facilitate tracheal intubation, and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation.[L9004]"
DB00203,"In single-dose volunteer studies of doses up to 800 mg, adverse reactions were similar to those seen at lower doses, but the incidence rates and severities were increased [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Doses of 200 mg did not result in increased efficacy but the incidence of adverse reaction (headache, flushing, dizziness, dyspepsia, nasal congestion, altered vision) was increased [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Due to the lack of data on the effect of sildenafil indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in pregnant women, sildenafil is not recommended for women of childbearing potential unless also using appropriate contraceptive measures [F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].
 
The safety and efficacy of sildenafil indicated for treating PAH in a woman during labor and delivery have not been studied [F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614]. Caution should ultimately be exercised when sildenafil is administered to nursing women as it is not known if sildenafil or its metabolites are excreted in human breast milk [F3850, F3859, F3883, L5614].

The safety and efficacy of sildenafil for the treatment of PAH in children below 1 year of age has not been established as no data is available [F3883].

Clinical experience with the elderly population in the use of sildenafil for the treatment of PAH has been varied. Some reports suggest that there are no identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients [F3850] while others have documented that clinical efficacy as measured by 6-minute walk distance could be less in elderly patients [L5614]. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [F3850].

Conversely, when sildenafil was used to treat erectile dysfunction in healthy elderly volunteers (65 years or over), a reduced clearance of sildenafil was observed [F3853, L5611]. This reduction resulted in about 90% higher plasma concentrations of sildenafil and the active N-desmethyl metabolite compared to those seen in healthy younger volunteers (18-45 years) [F3853, L5611]. Due to age-differences in plasma protein binding, the corresponding increase in free sildenafil plasma concentration was approximately 40% [F3853, L5611].

Sildenafil was not carcinogenic when administered to rats for 24 months at a dose resulting in total systemic drug exposure (AUCs) for unbound sildenafil and its major metabolite of 29- and 42- times, for male and female rats, respectively, the exposures observed in human males given the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 100 mg [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. Sildenafil was not carcinogenic when administered to mice for 18-21 months at dosages up to the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of 10 mg/kg/day, approximately 0.6 times the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

There was no impairment of fertility in rats given sildenafil up to 60 mg/kg/day for 36 days to females and 102 days to males, a dose producing an AUC value of more than 25 times the human male AUC [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].","Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor that is predominantly employed for two primary indications:

(1) the treatment of erectile dysfunction [A175582, L5611, F3853, F3856, F3886]; and

(2) treatment of pulmonary hypertension, where:
a) the US FDA specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group I) in adults to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening [F3850]. The delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated when sildenafil was added to background epoprostenol therapy [F3850]. Studies establishing effectiveness were short-term (12 to 16 weeks), and included predominately patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class II-III symptoms and idiopathic etiology (71%) or associated with connective tissue disease (CTD) (25%) [F3850];

b) the Canadian product monograph specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of primary pulmonary arterial hypertension (PPH) or pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease (CTD) in adult patients with WHO functional class II or III who have not responded to conventional therapy [F3859]. In addition, improvement in exercise ability and delay in clinical worsening was demonstrated in adult patients who were already stabilized on background epoprostenol therapy [F3859]; and

c) the EMA product information specifically indicates sildenafil for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise capacity [F3883]. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease [F3883]. The EMA label also indicates sildenafil for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 1 year to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension [F3883].

These doses, based on a mg/m2 basis, are approximately 4 and 2 times, respectively, the human daily dose of 500 mg. In the animal studies, no harmful effects to the fetus due to azithromycin were observed. There are, at this time, no conclusive and well-controlled studies that have been done in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies do not always predict human response, azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed [FDA label].

**Nursing Mothers**: 

It is unknown at this time whether azithromycin is excreted in human milk. Because many other drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be observed when azithromycin is given to a nursing woman [FDA label].

**Tumorigenicity**

Because of the chronic nature of GERD, there may be a potential for long-term administration of pantoprazole. In long-term rodent studies, pantoprazole was carcinogenic and its administration lead to rare types of gastrointestinal tumors. The relevance of these findings to tumor development in humans is unknown at this time.[F3202]

**Teratogenic Effects**

This drug falls under pregnancy category B category. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at oral doses up to 88 times the recommended human dose (RHD), as well as in rabbits at oral doses up to 16 times the RHD, and have shown no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus caused by pantoprazole. No adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have been completed. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should only be used during pregnancy if clearly required.[F3202]

**Nursing Mothers**

Pantoprazole and its metabolites have been found to be excreted in the milk of rats. Pantoprazole excretion in human milk has been found in a study performed with a single nursing mother after one 40 mg oral dose. The clinical relevance of this finding is not known, however, it is advisable to take note of this finding when considering pantoprazole use during nursing. Many drugs excreted in human breastmilk have a risk for serious adverse effects in nursing infants.[F3202]","

DB00215,"Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.[L47941]

Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy. There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy.[L47941]

Citalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.[L47941]

Citalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.[L47941]

Citalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses ≥ 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.[L47941] 

SSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients,
who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction.[L47941]

The following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:
• Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.[L47941]
• Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension is most commonly seen, but hypotension can rarely be seen alone or with co‐ingestants including alcohol.[L47941] 
• Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other pro-serotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).[L47941]

Prolonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1‐800‐221‐2222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.[L47941]

Citalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established. Citalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up to 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m2 body surface area.[L47941] 

Citalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.[L47941]

Citalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses ≥ 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased to 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.[L47941] ","Citalopram is approved by the FDA for treating adults with major depressive disorder.[L47941] It has also been used off-label to treat various diseases, including but not limited to sexual dysfunction, ethanol abuse, psychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and diabetic neuropathy.[L5224,A321,A322,A261296] "

tumorigenic effect was noted in mice at systemic exposures (Cmax) up to 9-fold those measured in humans at the recommended
therapeutic dose (750 mg TID or 1250 mg BID). In rats, thyroid follicular cell adenomas and carcinomas were increased in males at
300 mg/kg/day and higher and in females at 1000 mg/kg/day. Systemic exposures (Cmax) at 300 and 1000 mg/kg/day were 1- to 3-fold, respectively, those measured in humans at the recommended therapeutic dose. Repeated administration of nelfinavir to rats produced
effects consistent with hepatic microsomal enzyme induction and increased thyroid hormone deposition; these effects predispose rats, but not humans, to thyroid follicular cell neoplasms. Nelfinavir showed no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in a battery of in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology assays. These studies included bacterial mutation assays in S. typhimurium and E. coli, a mouse lymphoma tyrosine kinase assay, a chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes, and an in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay.[L36485]

Nelfinavir produced no effects on either male or female mating and fertility or embryo survival in rats at systemic exposures
comparable to the human therapeutic exposure.[L36485]

Human experience of acute overdose with nelfinavir is limited. There is no specific antidote for overdose with VIRACEPT. If
indicated, elimination of unabsorbed drug should be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage. Administration of activated charcoal may
also be used to aid the removal of unabsorbed drug. Since nelfinavir is highly protein-bound, dialysis is unlikely to significantly remove the drug from blood.[L36485]",Used in combination with other antiviral drugs in the treatment of HIV in both adults and children.[L36485]

DB00225,"GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention. The human data on the association between GBCAs and adverse fetal outcomes are limited and inconclusive. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse fetal effects were observed with the administration of gadodiamide to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses 1.3 times the maximum human dose based on body surface area. Because of the potential risks of gadolinium to the fetus, use gadodiamide only if imaging is essential during pregnancy and cannot be delayed.[L49881]

Clinical consequences of overdose with gadodiamide have not been reported. The minimum lethal dose of intravenously administered gadodiamide in rats and mice is greater than 20 mmol/kg (200 times the recommended human dose of 0.1 mmol/kg; 67 times the cumulative 0.3 mmol/kg dose).

DB00252,"The experience of phenytoin toxicity is not limited to situations of acute ingestion, but may also occur due to drug interactions or due to physiological circumstances that impact serum albumin (ie. kidney disease) or drug metabolism.[A188751] Other changes that may result in phenytoin toxicity include pregnancy, malnutrition and malignancy.[A188751]

Phenytoin toxicity most often affects the cardiovascular and nervous systems.[A188751] The most common presentation of toxicity depends on the route of administration.[A188751] Cardiovascular adverse effects are most commonly linked to intravenous phenytoin administration, whereas neurological adverse effects are more common with oral phenytoin administration.[A188751]

Neurotoxicity is usually dependent on serum concentrations.[A188751] When concentrations range from 10-20 mg/L, mild nystagmus and lateral gaze may occur, while more significant nystagmus is associated with concentrations ranging from 20-30 mg/L.[A188751] At concentrations of 30-40 mg/L, slurred speech, tremor, nausea, vomiting and ataxia have been reported.[A188751] In more serious cases where serum levels range from 40-50 mg/L patients are at risk of lethargy, confusion and hyperactivity, and at levels beyond 50 mg/L, coma and seizures may occur.[A188751]

Phenytoin is classified as an antiarrhythmic and can cause SA and AV nodal blocks as well as dysrhythmias due to its effect on voltage-gated sodium channels.[A188751] Further, since phenytoin is poorly soluble, the parenteral form is administered with propylene glycol, which is a cardiac depressant.[A188751] The infusion rate of parenteral phenytoin should not exceed 50 mg per minute due to the risk of hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole.[A188751]

Treatment for phenytoin toxicity is non-specific and centres around supportive care.[A188751] One dose of activated charcoal may be used to prevent phenytoin absorption in cases of acute ingestion.[A188751]

Although hemodialysis is moderately effective at removing phenytoin, it is not normally recommended due to the risks associated with the procedure, and the general effectiveness of supportive care.[A188751]","Phenytoin is indicated to treat grand mal seizures, complex partial seizures, and to prevent and treat seizures during or following neurosurgery.[L9362] Injectable phenytoin and [Fosphenytoin], which is the phosphate ester prodrug formulation of phenytoin[A188571], are indicated to treat tonic-clonic status epilepticus, and for the prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during neurosurgery.[L10740]"

Lidocaine readily crosses the placental barrier after epidural or intravenous administration to the mother [L5930]. The ratio of umbilical to maternal venous concentration is 0.5 to 0.6 [L5930]. The fetus appears to be capable of metabolizing lidocaine at term [L5930]. The elimination half-life in the newborn of the drug received in utero is about three hours, compared with 100 minutes in the adult [L5930]. Elevated lidocaine levels may persist in the newborn for at least 48 hours after delivery [L5930]. Fetal bradycardia or tachycardia, neonatal bradycardia, hypotonia or respiratory depression may occur [L5930].

Local anesthetics rapidly cross the placenta and when used for epidural, paracervical, pudendal or caudal block anesthesia, can cause varying degrees of maternal, fetal and neonatal toxicity [F4349]. The potential for toxicity depends upon the procedure performed, the type and amount of drug used, and the technique of drug administration [F4349]. Adverse reactions in the parturient, fetus and neonate involve alterations of the central nervous system, peripheral vascular tone, and cardiac function [F4349].

Maternal hypotension has resulted from regional anesthesia [F4349]. Local anesthetics produce vasodilation by blocking sympathetic nerves [F4349]. Elevating the patient’s legs and positioning her on her left side will help prevent decreases in blood pressure [F4349]. The fetal heart rate also should be monitored continuously, and electronic fetal monitoring is highly advisable [F4349].

Epidural, spinal, paracervical, or pudendal anesthesia may alter the forces of parturition through changes in uterine contractility or maternal expulsive efforts [F4349]. In one study, paracervical block anesthesia was associated with a decrease in the mean duration of first stage labor and facilitation of cervical dilation [F4349]. However, spinal and epidural anesthesia have also been reported to prolong the second stage of labor by removing the parturient’s reflex urge to bear down or by interfering with motor function [F4349]. The use of obstetrical anesthesia may increase the need for forceps assistance [F4349].

The use of some local anesthetic drug products during labor and delivery may be followed by diminished muscle strength and tone for the first day or two of life [F4349]. The long-term significance of these observations is unknown [F4349]. Fetal bradycardia may occur in 20 to 30 percent of patients receiving paracervical nerve block anesthesia with the amide-type local anesthetics and may be associated with fetal acidosis [F4349]. Fetal heart rate should always be monitored during paracervical anesthesia [F4349]. The physician should weigh the possible advantages against risks when considering a paracervical block in prematurity, toxemia of pregnancy, and fetal distress [F4349]. Careful adherence to the recommended dosage is of the utmost importance in obstetrical paracervical block [F4349]. Failure to achieve adequate analgesia with recommended doses should arouse suspicion of intravascular or fetal intracranial injection [F4349]. Cases compatible with unintended fetal intracranial injection of local anesthetic solution have been reported following intended paracervical or pudendal block or both. Babies so affected present with unexplained neonatal depression at birth, which correlates with high local anesthetic serum levels, and often manifest seizures within six hours [F4349]. Prompt use of supportive measures combined with forced urinary excretion of the local anesthetic has been used successfully to manage this complication [F4349].

It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk [F4349]. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when lidocaine is administered to a nursing woman [F4349].

Dosages in children should be reduced, commensurate with age, body weight and physical condition [F4349].

The oral LD 50 of lidocaine HCl in non-fasted female rats is 459 (346-773) mg/kg (as the salt) and 214 (159-324) mg/kg (as the salt) in fasted female rats [F4349].","Lidocaine is an anesthetic of the amide group indicated for production of local or regional anesthesia by infiltration techniques such as percutaneous injection and intravenous regional anesthesia by peripheral nerve block techniques such as brachial plexus and intercostal and by central neural techniques such as lumbar and caudal epidural blocks [F4349, L5930]."

**Reproductive Toxicity**

Valproate use in pregnancy is known to increase the risk of neural tube defects and other structural abnormalities.[FDA Label] The risk of spina bifida increases from 0.06-0.07% in the normal population to 1-2% in valproate users. The North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED)
Pregnancy Registry reports a major malformation rate of 9-11%, 5 times the baseline rate. These malformations include neural tube defects, cardiovascular malformations, craniofacial defects (e.g., oral clefts, craniosynostosis), hypospadias, limb malformations (e.g., clubfoot, polydactyly), and other malformations of varying severity involving other body systems. Other antiepileptic drugs, lamotrigine, carbemazepine, and phenytoin, have been found to reduce IQ in children exposed in utero. Valproate was also studied however the results did not achieve statistical significance (97 IQ (CI: 94-101)). Observational studies report an absolute risk increase of 2.9% (relative risk 2.9 times baseline) of autism spectrum disorder in children exposed to valproate in utero. There have been case reports of fatal hepatic failure in children of mothers who used valproate during pregnancy.

There have been reports of male infertility when taking valproate.[FDA Label]

**Lactation**

Valproate is excreted in human milk.[FDA Label] Data in the published literature describe the presence of valproate in human milk (range: 0.4 mcg/mL to 3.9 mcg/mL), corresponding to 1% to 10% of maternal serum levels. Valproate serum concentrations collected from breastfed infants aged 3 days postnatal to 12 weeks following delivery ranged from 0.7 mcg/mL to 4 mcg/mL, which were 1% to 6% of maternal serum valproate levels. A published study in children up to six years of age did not report adverse developmental or cognitive effects following exposure to valproate
via breast milk.

**Overdose and liver toxicity** 

Acetaminophen overdose may be manifested by renal tubular necrosis, hypoglycemic coma, and thrombocytopenia. Sometimes, liver necrosis can occur as well as liver failure. Death and the requirement of a liver transplant may also occur.[L4396] Metabolism by the CYP2E1 pathway releases a toxic acetaminophen metabolite known as _N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine_(NAPQI). The toxic effects caused by this drug are attributed to NAPQI, not acetaminophen alone.[F4133]

**Carcinogenesis**

Long-term studies in mice and rats have been completed by the National Toxicology Program to study the carcinogenic risk of acetaminophen. In 2-year feeding studies, F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice consumed a diet containing acetaminophen up to 6,000 ppm. Female rats showed evidence of carcinogenic activity demonstrated by a higher incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia at doses 0.8 times the maximum human daily dose (MHDD). No evidence of carcinogenesis in male rats (0.7 times) or mice (1.2 to 1.4 times the MHDD) was noted.[L4396] The clinical relevance of this finding in humans is unknown.

**Mutagenesis**

Acetaminophen was not found to be mutagenic in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test). Despite this finding, acetaminophen tested positive in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay as well as the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay using human lymphocytes. In published studies, acetaminophen has been reported to be clastogenic (disrupting chromosomes) when given a high dose of 1,500 mg/kg/day to the rat model (3.6 times the MHDD). No clastogenicity was observed at a dose of 750 mg/kg/day (1.8 times the MHDD), indicating that this drug has a threshold before it may cause mutagenesis.[L4396] The clinical relevance of this finding in humans is unknown.

In studies conducted by the National Toxicology Program, fertility assessments have been performed in Swiss mice in a continuous breeding study. No effects on fertility were seen.[L4396] 

**Use in pregnancy and nursing**

The FDA label for acetaminophen considers it a pregnancy category C drug, meaning this drug has demonstrated adverse effects in animal studies. No human clinical studies in pregnancy have been done to this date for intravenous acetaminophen.[L4396] Use acetaminophen only when necessary during pregnancy.[L4396] Epidemiological data on oral acetaminophen use in pregnant women demonstrate no increase in the risk of major congenital malformations.[L4396] While prospective clinical studies examining the results of nursing with acetaminophen use have not been conducted, acetaminophen is found secreted in human milk at low concentrations after oral administration. Data from more than 15 nursing mothers taking acetaminophen was obtained, and the calculated daily dose of acetaminophen that reaches the infant is about 1 to 2% of the maternal dose. Caution should be observed when acetaminophen is taken by a nursing woman.[L4396]","In general, acetaminophen is used for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and reduction of fever.[F4124] It is available over the counter in various forms, the most common being oral forms.

Acetaminophen _injection_ is indicated for the management of mild to moderate pain, the management of moderate to severe pain with adjunctive opioid analgesics, and the reduction of fever.[L4396]

Because of its low risk of causing allergic reactions, this drug can be administered in patients who are intolerant to salicylates and those with allergic tendencies, including bronchial asthmatics.[F4124] Specific dosing guidelines should be followed when administering acetaminophen to children.[L5780]"

**Overdose/toxicity**

Symptoms of opioid toxicity may include confusion, somnolence, shallow breathing, constricted pupils, nausea, vomiting, constipation and a lack of appetite. In severe cases, symptoms of circulatory and respiratory depression may ensue, which may be life-threatening or fatal [L5506], [FDA label]. 

**Teratogenic effects**

This drug is classified as a pregnancy Category C drug. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies completed in pregnant women. Codeine should only be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk of the drug to the fetus [FDA label]. 

Codeine has shown embryolethal and fetotoxic effects in the hamster, rat as well as mouse models at about 2-4 times the maximum recommended human dose [FDA label]. Maternally toxic doses that were about 7 times the maximum recommended human dose of 360 mg/day, were associated with evidence of bone resorption and incomplete bone ossification. Codeine did not demonstrate evidence of embrytoxicity or fetotoxicity in the rabbit model at doses up to 2 times the maximum recommended human dose of 360 mg/day based on a body surface area comparison [FDA label]. 

**Nonteratogenic effects**

Neonatal codeine withdrawal has been observed in infants born to addicted and non-addicted mothers who ingested codeine-containing medications in the days before delivery. Common symptoms of narcotic withdrawal include irritability, excessive crying, tremors, hyperreflexia, seizures, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and poor feeding. These signs may be observed shortly following birth and may require specific treatment [FDA label]. 
 
Codeine (30 mg/kg) given subcutaneously to pregnant rats during gestation and for 25 days after delivery increased the rate of neonatal mortality at birth. The dose given was 0.8 times the maximum recommended human dose of 360 mg/day [FDA label]. 

**The use in breastfeeding/nursing**

Codeine is secreted into human milk. The maternal use of codeine can potentially lead to serious adverse reactions, including death, in nursing infants [FDA label]. ","Codeine sulfate is a form of this drug that is commonly used. It is available in tablet form [FDA label] and indicated for the relief of mild to moderately severe pain, where the use of an opioid analgesic is appropriate [FDA label].

For amitriptyline, only limited clinical data are available regarding its use in pregnancy.
Amitriptyline is not recommended during pregnancy unless clearly required and only after careful consideration of both risks and benefits [FDA label].

**Use in breastfeeding**

Amitriptyline and its metabolites are excreted into breast milk (corresponding to 0.6 % - 1 % of the maternal dose). A risk to the suckling child must be considered. A decision should be made as to whether it is appropriate to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue/abstain from the therapy of this medicinal product, considering the benefit of breastfeeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.

**Effects on fertility**

Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity. No data on the effects of amitriptyline on human fertility are available [FDA label].


**Mutagenesis and carcinogenesis**

The genotoxic potential of amitriptyline has been investigated in various in vitro and in vivo studies. Although these investigations showed

**A note on lactic acidosis**

Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, thereby increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis.[L40243] There have been reported postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including some fatal cases. Such cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms including malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence. In certain cases, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe lactic acidosis.[L40243] Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/L), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), as well as an increased lactate:pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL.[L40243]

Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.[L40243]

**A note on renal function**

In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased.[L40243]

Metformin should be avoided in those with severely compromised renal function (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min), acute/decompensated heart failure, severe liver disease and for 48 hours after the use of iodinated contrast dyes due to the risk of lactic acidosis.[L40243] Lower doses should be used in the elderly and those with decreased renal function. Metformin decreases fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Metformin may also have a positive effect on lipid levels. 

**A note on hypoglycemia**

 When used alone, metformin does not cause hypoglycemia, however, it may potentiate the hypoglycemic effects of sulfonylureas and insulin when they are used together.[L40243]

**Use in pregnancy** 

Available data from post-marketing studies have not indicated a clear association of metformin with major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin was ingested during pregnancy. Despite this, the abovementioned studies cannot definitively establish the absence of any metformin-associated risk due to methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent study groups.[L40243]

**Use in nursing**

A limited number of published studies indicate that metformin is present in human milk. There is insufficient information to confirm the effects of metformin on the nursing infant and no available data on the effects of metformin on the production of milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered as well as the mother’s clinical need for metformin and any possible adverse effects on the nursing child.[L40243]","**Metformin immediate-release formulations**

In a fertility and reproduction study in mice, cetirizine did not negatively impact fertility at an oral dose of 64 mg/kg (approximately 25 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults) [FDA label]. 


**Pregnancy Category B**: 

In mice, rats, and rabbits, cetirizine was not teratogenic at oral doses up to 96, 225, and 135 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 40, 180 and 220 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults). There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal studies are not always predictive of human response, cetirizine should be used in pregnancy only if clearly needed [FDA label]. 

**Use in breastfeeding/nursing**

Cetirizine has been reported to be excreted in human breast milk. The use of cetirizine in nursing mothers is not recommended [FDA label].","**Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis**: Indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis caused by allergens such as ragweed, grass and tree pollens in adults and children 2 years of age and above. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal pruritus, ocular pruritus, tearing, and redness of the eyes [FDA label]. 

**Perennial allergic rhinitis**: This drug is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with perennial allergic rhinitis due to allergens including dust mites, animal dander, and molds in adults and children 6 months of age and older. Symptoms treated effectively include sneezing, rhinorrhea, postnasal discharge, nasal pruritus, ocular pruritus, and tearing [FDA label]. 

**Chronic urticaria**: Cetirizine is indicated for the treatment of the uncomplicated skin manifestations of chronic idiopathic urticaria in adults and children 6 months of age and older. It markedly reduces the occurrence, severity, and duration of hives and significantly reduces pruritus [FDA label]."

DB00342,"Mild (e.g., headache, nausea, confusion), but adverse cardiac events including cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias including torsades de pointes and QT prolongation have been reported. LD<sub>50</sub>=mg/kg (orally in mice)","For the treatment of allergic rhinitis, hay fever, and allergic skin disorders."
DB00343,"**Clinical Toxicity and Overdose**

The oral LD<sub>50</sub> ranges from 415 to 740mg/kg in mice and 560 to 810 mg/kg in rats. The oral LD<sub>50</sub> in dogs is considered to be in excess of 50 mg/kg. A dose of 360 mg/kg resulted in lethality in monkeys. The intravenous LD<sub>50</sub> is 60 mg/kg in mice and 38 mg/kg in rats. 

Cases of overdose from doses ranging from less than 1 g to 18 g have been reported with diltiazem, with several cases involving multiple drug ingestions resulting in death. Overdoses were associated with bradycardia, hypotension, heart block, and cardiac failure that may manifest as dizziness, lightheadedness, and fatigue.[L6289] Actual treatment and dosage should depend on the severity of the clinical situation and the judgment and experience of the treating physician. Diltiazem overdose should be responded with appropriate supportive measures and gastrointestinal decontamination. Bradycardia and heart block can be treated with atropine at doses ranging from 0.60 to 1.0 mg. In the case of bradycardia, if there is no response to vagal blockage, cautious administration of isoproterenol should be considered. Cardiac pacing can also be used to treat fixed high-degree AV block. In the case of heart failure, blood pressure may be maintained with the use of fluids and vasopressors, as well as inotropic agents such as [isoproterenol], [dopamine], or [dobutamine]. Other appropriate measures include ventilatory support, gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and/or intravenous calcium. Diltiazem does not appear to be removed by peritoneal or hemodialysis.[L10556]

**Non-clinical toxicity**

In a 24-month study in rats receiving oral doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. There was also no mutagenic response _in vitro_ or _in vivo_ in mammalian cell assays or _in vitro_ bacterial assays. No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in a study performed in male and female rats receiving oral doses of up to 100 mg/kg/day.[L10556]

**Pregnancy and Lactation**

In reproduction studies in animals, administration of diltiazem at doses ranging from five to twenty times the daily recommended human therapeutic dose resulted in cases of the embryo and fetal lethality and skeletal abnormalities, and an increase in the risk of stillbirths. There have been no up-to-date controlled studies that investigated the use of diltiazem in pregnant women. The use of diltiazem in pregnant women should be undertaken only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus.[L10556] Diltiazem is excreted in human milk, where one report suggests that the concentrations in breast milk may approximate serum levels; therefore, the decision should be made to either discontinue nursing or the use of the drug after careful consideration of the clinical necessity of diltiazem therapy in the nursing mother.[L10556]

**Use in special populations**

As there is limited information on the variable effects of diltiazem in geriatric patients, the initial therapy of diltiazem should involve the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Currently, there are no specific dosing guidelines for patients with renal or hepatic impairment.[L10556]","**Oral**

DB00349,"Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association between benzodiazepines and major birth defects.[L44888]

Administration of clobazam to pregnant rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis or to rats throughout pregnancy and lactation resulted in developmental toxicity, including increased incidences of fetal malformations and mortality, at plasma
exposures for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, below those expected at therapeutic doses in patients. Data for other benzodiazepines suggest the possibility of long-term effects on neurobehavioral and immunological function in animals following prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines at clinically relevant doses. ONFI should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Advise a pregnant woman and women of childbearing age of the potential risk to a fetus.[L44888]

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to clobazam during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to clobazam during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].[L44888] 

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively.[L44888] 

Administration of clobazam to rats prior to and during mating and early gestation resulted in adverse effects on fertility and early embryonic development at plasma exposures for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, below those in humans at the MRHD [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].[L44888]

In a study in which clobazam (0, 4, 36, or 120 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to rats during the juvenile period of development (postnatal days 14 to 48), adverse effects on growth (decreased bone density and bone length) and behavior (altered motor activity and auditory startle response; learning deficit) were observed at the high dose. The effect on bone density, but not on behavior, was reversible when the drug was discontinued. The no-effect level for juvenile toxicity (36 mg/kg/day) was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) to clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, less than those expected at therapeutic doses in pediatric patients.[L44888]   

In mice, oral administration of clobazam (0, 6, 12, or 24 mg/kg/day) for 2 years did not result in an increase in tumors. The highest dose tested was approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 40 mg/day, based on body surface
area (mg/m2).[L44888]

In rats, oral administration of clobazam for 2 years resulted in increases in tumors of the thyroid gland (follicular cell adenoma and carcinoma) and liver (hepatocellular adenoma) at the mid and high doses. The low dose, not associated with an increase in tumors, was associated with plasma exposures (AUC) for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, less than that in humans at the MRHD.[L44888] 

Clobazam and the major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, were negative for genotoxicity, based on data from a battery of in vitro (bacteria reverse mutation, mammalian clastogenicity) and in vivo (mouse micronucleus) assays.[L44888] 

In a fertility study in which clobazam (50, 350, or 750 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 12, 84, and 181 times the oral Maximum Recommended Human Dose, MRHD, of 40 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface) was orally administered to male and female rats prior to and during mating and continuing in females to gestation day 6, increases in abnormal sperm and pre-implantation loss were observed at the highest dose tested. The no-effect level for fertility and early embryonic development in rats was associated with
plasma exposures (AUC) for clobazam and its major active metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam, less than those in humans at the maximum recommended human dose of 40 mg/day.[L44888] 

Clobazam is a benzodiazepine and a CNS depressant with a potential for abuse and addiction. Abuse is the intentional, non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desirable psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for
therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Even taking benzodiazepines as prescribed may put patients at risk for abuse and misuse of their medication. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines may lead to addiction.[L44888]

Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines often (but not always) involve the use of doses greater than the maximum recommended dosage and commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes, including respiratory depression, overdose, or death. Benzodiazepines are often sought by individuals who abuse drugs and other substances, and by individuals with addictive disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].[L44888]

The following adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: abdominal pain, amnesia, anorexia, anxiety, aggression, ataxia, blurred vision, confusion, depression, disinhibition, disorientation, dizziness, euphoria, impaired concentration and memory, indigestion, irritability, muscle pain, slurred speech, tremors, and vertigo.[L44888]

The following severe adverse reactions have occurred with benzodiazepine abuse and/or misuse: delirium, paranoia, suicidal ideation and behavior, seizures, coma, breathing difficulty, and death. Death is more often associated with polysubstance use (especially benzodiazepines with other CNS depressants such as opioids and alcohol).[L44888]

The World Health Organization epidemiology database contains reports of drug abuse, misuse, and overdoses associated with clobazam.[L44888]

Clobazam may produce physical dependence from continued therapy. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of benzodiazepines or administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, including seizures, which can be life-threatening.[L44888]

Patients at an increased risk of withdrawal adverse reactions after benzodiazepine discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction include those who take higher dosages (i.e., higher and/or more frequent doses) and those who have had longer durations of use
[see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. In clinical trials, cases of dependency were reported following the abrupt discontinuation of clobazam.[L44888]

Acute withdrawal signs and symptoms associated with benzodiazepines have included abnormal involuntary movements, anxiety, blurred vision, depersonalization, depression, derealization, dizziness, fatigue, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (e.g.,nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, decreased appetite), headache, hyperacusis,hypertension, irritability, insomnia, memory impairment, muscle pain and stiffness, panic attacks, photophobia, restlessness, tachycardia, and tremor. More severe acute withdrawal signs and symptoms, including life-threatening reactions, have included catatonia, convulsions, delirium tremens, depression, hallucinations, mania, psychosis, seizures, and suicidality.[L44888]

Protracted withdrawal syndrome associated with benzodiazepines is characterized by anxiety, cognitive impairment, depression, insomnia, formication, motor symptoms (e.g., weakness, tremor, muscle twitches), paresthesia, and tinnitus that persists beyond 4 to 6 weeks after initial benzodiazepine withdrawal. Protracted withdrawal symptoms may last weeks to more than 12 months. As a result, there may be difficulty in differentiating withdrawal symptoms from potential re-emergence or continuation of symptoms for
which the benzodiazepine was being used.[L44888]

Tolerance to clobazam may develop from continued therapy. Tolerance is a physiological state characterized by a reduced response to a drug after repeated administration (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was once obtained at a lower dose). Tolerance to the therapeutic effect of clobazam may develop; however, little tolerance develops to the amnestic reactions and other cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines.[L44888] 

Overdosage of benzodiazepines is characterized by central nervous system depression ranging from drowsiness to coma. In mild to moderate cases, symptoms can include drowsiness, confusion, dysarthria, lethargy, hypnotic state, diminished reflexes, ataxia, and hypotonia. Rarely, paradoxical or disinhibitory reactions (including agitation, irritability, impulsivity, violent behavior, confusion, restlessness, excitement, and talkativeness) may occur. In severe overdosage cases, patients may develop respiratory depression and coma. Overdosage of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol and opioids) may be fatal [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Markedly abnormal (lowered or elevated) blood pressure, heart rate, or respiratory rate raises the concern that additional drugs and/or alcohol are involved in the overdosage.[L44888]

In managing benzodiazepine overdosage, employ general supportive measures, including intravenous fluids and airway maintenance. Flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist indicated for the complete or partial reversal of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines in the management of benzodiazepine overdosage, can lead to withdrawal and adverse reactions, including seizures, particularly in the context of mixed overdosage with drugs that increase seizure risk (e.g., tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants) and in patients with long-term benzodiazepine use and physical dependency. The risk of withdrawal seizures with flumazenil may be increased in patients with epilepsy. Flumazenil is contraindicated in patients who have received a benzodiazepine for control of a potentially life-threatening condition (e.g., status epilepticus). If the decision is made to use flumazenil, it should be used as an adjunct to, not as a substitute for, supportive management of benzodiazepine overdosage. See
the flumazenil injection Prescribing Information.[L44888]

Consider contacting the Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.[L44888]",Clobazam is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age or older.[L44888]

The studies revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to clozapine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, CLOZARIL should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.[L905]

Consider the risk of exacerbation of psychosis when discontinuing or changing treatment with antipsychotic medications
during pregnancy and postpartum. Consider early screening for gestational diabetes for patients treated with antipsychotic

Clozapine is also indicated for reducing the risk of recurrent suicidal behavior in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who are judged to be at chronic risk for re-experiencing suicidal behavior, based on history and recent clinical state. Suicidal behavior refers to actions by a patient that put him/herself at risk for death.[L905]"
DB00364,"**Overdose**

Overdosage has never been observed with sucralfate [F4519]. It is unlikely, as administering a maximum dose of up to 12 g/kg/body weight in several animal species did not result in death. The lethal dose could not be determined in these studies [F4519]. It is likely that overdose of sucralfate in humans would result in constipation, and supportive treatment would be advised [F4519].

**Use in pregnancy**

This drug is considered a pregnancy Category B drug. Studies have been performed in rodents and rabbits at doses up to 50 times the recommended human dose.  No harm to the fetus has been observed in the abovementioned studies. Sufficient and well-controlled clinical trials have not been performed in pregnant women. Due to the fact that the results of animal studies are not always relevant to human response, sucralfate should be used during pregnancy only if it is deemed essential for the mother's health [FDA label].


**Use in nursing**

Whether this drug is excreted in human milk is currently unknown. Many drugs are excreted in breast milk, therefore, if sucralfate is administered to a lactating and nursing woman, caution should be observed [FDA label].

**Carcinogenesis** 

24 month toxicity studies were performed in rodents, and the dose of sucralfate reached up to 1 g/kg (equivalent to 12 times the recommended human dose). No signs of sucralfate-related tumors were noted[FDA label].","The sucralfate suspension [FDA label] and tablet [F4534] are used for the treatment of active duodenal ulcer for up to 8 weeks.  The tablet form may be used at a lower dose for healed duodenal ulcers, for the purpose of maintaining healing and preventing recurrence [F4519, F4534].

There is no specific antidote for a levonorgestrel overdose.[L7760,L7793,L7796]","**Emergency contraception**

Levonorgestrel, in the single-agent emergency contraceptive form, is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy after the confirmed or suspected failure of contraception methods or following unprotected intercourse. It is distributed by prescription for patients under 17, and over the counter for those above this age.[L7760] This levonorgestrel-only form of contraception is not indicated for regular contraception and must be taken as soon as possible within 72 hours after intercourse.[A181976,L7760] It has shown a lower efficacy when it is used off label within 96 hours.[T659]

**Long-term contraception or nonemergency contraception**

In addition to the above indication in emergency contraception, levonorgestrel is combined with other contraceptives in contraceptive formulations designed for regular use, for example with ethinyl estradiol.[L7766] It is used in various hormone-releasing intrauterine devices for long-term contraception ranging for a duration of 3-5 years.[L7778,L7781,L7787] Product labeling for Mirena specifically mentions that it is recommended in women who have had at least 1 child and can be indicated for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 8 years.[L7778,L42950] A subdermal implant is also available for the prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years.[L7823]

**Hormone therapy and off-label uses**

Oral LD50 was 830 mg/kg in male Swiss mice 24 hours after being administered mirtazapine.[F4597]  

**Overdose information**

Activated charcoal should be administered during an overdose to absorb excess mirtazapine. General supportive therapy should be employed, including maintenance of an adequate airway, oxygen therapy, and ventilation therapy. Vital signs and cardiac rhythm must be monitored. It is not advisable to induce vomiting. Gastric lavage with a large-bore orogastric tube with proper protection of the airway is recommended [FDA label]. There is no antidote for mirtazapine available currently.[FDA label] Consider the possibility of mirtazapine combined with other drugs in an overdose and ensure to contact the local poison control center for guidance on management.[FDA label]
 
**Carcinogenesis**

At higher than normal doses, mirtazapine increased the incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in male mice. The highest doses administered to the mice were about 20 and 12 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD).[FDA label] Hepatocellular tumors and thyroid follicular adenoma/cystadenomas in male rats occurred at an increased rate at a higher mirtazapine dose (60 mg/kg/day). In female rats, both the medium (20 mg/kg/day) and higher (60 mg/kg/day) doses of mirtazapine increased the rate of hepatocellular adenomas.[FDA label]  The relevance of these findings in humans is not known at this time.[FDA label]

**Impairment of Fertility**

Mirtazapine was administered to rats at doses reaching 100 mg/kg (equivalent to 20 times the maximum recommended human dose) in a fertility study. There was no impact on mating and conception, however, there was a disturbance of reproductive (estrous) cycling at higher doses.  These doses were measured to be at least 3 times the maximum recommended human dose. Loss of fetus before implantation in the uterus occurred when doses equivalent to 20 times the maximum recommended dose were administered.[FDA label]

**Use in pregnancy**

This drug is categorized as a pregnancy category C drug. No adequate studies in pregnant women have been conducted.  In rats, an increased rate of post-implantation demise occurred with mirtazapine administration. Additionally, an increase in deaths of rat pups during the first 3 days of lactation with a decrease in pup birth weight was noted. Studies on animals are not always relevant to human response. Mirtazapine should be used during pregnancy only if the clinical need outweighs the possible risks to the fetus.[FDA label]

**Use in nursing**

Whether this drug is excreted in human milk is unknown.[FDA label] Many drugs are found excreted in human breast milk, therefore caution is advised if this drug is used during nursing.[FDA label]","This drug is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder and its associated symptoms.[FDA label]

DB00375,"Overdosage with colestipol has not been reported [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. Regardless, in the case of overdosage, the chief potential harm would be obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. The location of such potential obstruction, the degree of obstruction and the presence or absence of normal gut motility would determine treatment [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].

No clinical data are available on the use of colestipol in pregnant women and during lactation [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].  Colestipol does not appear to be absorbed systematically [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. Due to its known interference with absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, the use of colestipol in pregnancy or lactation or by women of childbearing potential requires that the benefits of drug therapy be weighed against the possible hazards to the mother and the child [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].

There are no data on the effect of colestipol on fertility in humans [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].

The use of colestipol in children is limited [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. Clinical trials conducted in children with colestipol ranules have usually employed doses of 5 to 20 g/day [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel recommends drug therapy be considered in children 10 years or older, who have previously undergone an adequate trial of diet therapy but still have unacceptably high serum cholesterol levels [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. In certain situations where a young child has extremely high serum cholesterol levels, drug treatment may even be initiated before 10 years of age [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. If the child is started on drug therapy, a carefully assessed diet therapy should also be continued in order to obtain optimal results [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. However, the safety of using colestipol tablets in patients under the age of 18 years has not been established [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. Furthermore, because bile acid sequestrants like colestipol may interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, appropriate monitoring of growth and development is essential if colestipol is used in children [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567].

Appropriate studies on the relationship of age to the effects of colestipol have not been performed in the geriatric population [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. However, patients over 60 years of age may be more likely to experience gastrointestinal side effects, as well as adverse nutritional effects [FDA Label, L6115, F4555, F4567]. 

Additionally, it has been determined that the oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is > 1000 mg/kg [MSDS].","Colestipol is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet for the reduction of elevated serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (a condition that features elevated LDL-C) who do not respond adequately to dietary changes .[FDA Label,L6115,F4555]

Therapy with lipid-altering agents like colestipol should be a component of multiple risk factor intervention in those individuals at significantly increased risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia [FDA Label, L6115, F4555]. Treatment should begin and continue with dietary therapy [FDA Label, L6115, F4555]. In general, a minimum of six months of intensive dietary therapy and counseling should be carried out prior to initiation of drug therapy such as that with colestipol [FDA Label, F4555]. Shorter periods may be considered in patients with severe elevations of LDL-C or with definite coronary heart disease [FDA Label, F4555].

Although colestipol is effective in all types of hypercholesterolemia, some regional prescribing information note in particular that it is medically most appropriate in patients with Fredrickson's type II hyperlipoproteinemia [L6115]. Nevertheless, in patients with combined hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, although colestipol may be helpful in reducing elevated cholesterol, it is not formally indicated where hypertriglyceridemia is the abnormality of greatest concern [F4567]."

**Overdose**

An overdose of carisoprodol leads to CNS depression, and in severe cases, induction of a coma. Shock, depression of respiratory function, seizures and death have also been reported in rare cases. Several symptoms may be associated with carisoprodol overdose, such as horizontal and vertical nystagmus, blurred vision, mydriasis, mild tachycardia and hypotension, respiratory depression, euphoria, CNS stimulation, muscular incoordination, and/or rigidity, confusion, headache, hallucinations, and dystonic reactions. Alcohol or other CNS depressants or psychotropic agents can exert additive effects on carisoprodol even when one of the agents has been ingested at the normal, therapeutic dose. Fatal accidental and non-accidental overdoses have both been reported with carisoprodol ingestion alone or ingestion of carisoprodol in combination with alcohol or psychotropic drugs [F4057].

In the postmarketing reports after carisoprodol use, cases of dependence, withdrawal, and abuse have been reported with long-term use. The majority of dependence and withdrawal cases, as well as abuse, have occurred in patients with a history of addiction or who have used this drug in combination with other drugs having abuse potential. However, multiple post-marketing adverse event reports have been made of carisodopril-associated abuse when used without other drugs possessing abuse potential. Withdrawal symptoms have been observed and reported following sudden abrupt cessation after long-term carisodoprol use. To reduce the chance of carisodopril dependence, withdrawal, or abuse, carisodopril should be used with caution in addiction-prone patients and in patients taking other CNS depressants including alcohol. This drug should not be taken for longer than 2 to 3 weeks for symptomatic relief of acute musculoskeletal discomfort [FDA label].

**Use in pregnancy**

This drug has been classified as Pregnancy Category C. There are no clinical trial data on the use of carisoprodol during human pregnancy. Animal studies show that carisoprodol crosses the placenta and leads to adverse effects on fetal growth and postnatal survival. In postmarketing reports, the main metabolite, _meprobamate_, has not demonstrated a consistent association between maternal use and an increased risk for specific congenital malformations [FDA label].

**Use in nursing**

Limited data in humans demonstrate that this is found excreted in breast milk and may reach concentrations in breast milk of 2-4 times the maternal plasma concentrations [FDA label]. It is therefore advisable to exercise caution when this drug is used during breastfeeding [FDA label].
","Carisoprodol is indicated for the relief of discomfort related to acute, painful musculoskeletal conditions [FDA label].


**Important limitations of use** [FDA label]:

• Should only be used for acute treatment periods up to two or three weeks 

• Adequate evidence of effectiveness for more prolonged use has not been established 

• Not recommended in pediatric patients less than 16 years of age"
DB00396,"Intraperitoneal LD50 (rat): 327 mg/kg [MSDS]. 

**Use in pregnancy**

Only forms of progesterone that are indicated on product labeling for pregnancy should be used. Some forms of progesterone should not be used in pregnancy [FDA label], [F3904].  Refer to individual product monographs for information regarding use in pregnancy. Many studies have found no effects on fetal development associated with long-term use of contraceptive doses of oral progestins. Studies of infant growth and development that have been conducted have not demonstrated significant adverse effects, however, these studies are few in number. It is therefore advisable to rule out suspected pregnancy before starting any hormonal contraceptive [F3904]. 

**Effects on fertility**

Progesterone at high doses is an antifertility drug and high doses would be expected to impair fertility until cessation [F3916]. The progesterone contraceptive should not be used during pregnancy. 

**Carcinogenicity**

Progesterone has been shown to induce or promote the formation of ovarian, uterine, mammary, and genital tract tumors in animals. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown [F3913]. Certain epidemiological studies of patients using oral contraceptives have reported an increased relative risk of developing breast cancer, especially at a younger age and associated with a longer duration of use. These studies have mainly involved combined oral contraceptives, and therefore, it is unknown whether this risk is attributable to progestins, estrogens, or a combination of both. At this time, there is insufficient data to determine whether the use of progestin-only contraceptives increases the risk in a similar way to combined contraceptives. A meta-analysis of 54 studies showed a small increase in the frequency of breast cancer diagnosis for women who were currently using combined oral contraceptives, or had used them within the past 10 years. There was no increase in the frequency of having breast cancer diagnosed ten or more years after cessation of hormone use. Women with breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives, as there is no sufficient data to fully establish or negate the risk of cancer with hormonal contraceptive use [F3904]. 

**Use in breastfeeding**

Progesterone has been detected in the milk of nursing mothers [F3901], [F3904]. No adverse effects, in general, have been found on breastfeeding ability or on the health, growth, or development of the growing infant. Despite this, isolated post-marketing cases of decreased milk production have been reported [F3904]. ","**Gelatinized capsules**

The gelatinized capsules are indicated for use in the prevention of endometrial hyperplasia in non-hysterectomized postmenopausal women who are receiving conjugated estrogens tablets. They are also indicated for use in secondary amenorrhea [FDA label]. 

**Vaginal gel**

Progesterone gel (8%) is indicated as progesterone supplementation or replacement as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology (“ART”) treatment for infertile women with progesterone deficiency.  The lower concentration progesterone gel (4%) is used in the treatment of secondary amenorrhea, with the use of the 8% concentration if there is no therapeutic response to the 4% gel [F3898].

**Vaginal insert**

This form is indicated to support embryo implantation and early pregnancy by supplementation of corpus luteal function as part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) treatment program for infertile women [F3901].

**Injection (intramuscular)**

This drug is indicated in amenorrhea and abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance in the absence of organic pathology, such as submucous fibroids or uterine cancer [F3907].

**Carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, impact on fertility**

Pramipexole was not found to be carcinogenic in 2-year studies on mice and rats at 0.3, 2.2, and 11 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No increased incidence of tumors was observed [FDA label]. No mutagenicity was detected in various assays, including the Ames test.  Finally, pramipexole given to rat models at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day (5 times the maximum recommended human dose), increased estrus cycles and inhibited implantation of a fertilized ovum. Decreased levels of prolactin, a hormone necessary for implantation and maintenance of early pregnancy, were measured [FDA label]. The significance of these findings in humans is unknown. 

**Pregnancy**

This drug is considered a pregnancy category C drug, showing teratogenic effects in animals. Currently, there no studies of pramipexole in human pregnancy. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. This drug should only be used in pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the possible fetal risks [FDA label]. 

**Nursing**

Whether pramipexole is excreted in human milk is unknown.  A decision should be made regarding the administration pramipexole during nursing, or whether to discontinue it during nursing, as many drugs are excreted in human milk.

Following rapid decreases in dose or abrupt discontinuation of zolpidem and other sedative/hypnotics, reports of signs and symptoms similar to those associated with withdrawal from other CNS-depressant drugs have been made [FDA label]. 

**Carcinogenesis**

Zolpidem was administered to rats and mice over a span of 2 years at dietary dosages of 4, 18, and 80 mg/kg/day. In mice, these doses are considered 26 to 520 times or 2 to 35 times the maximum 10 mg human dose, respectively. In rats, these doses are 43 to 876 times or 6 to 115 times the maximum 10 mg human dose. No evidence of carcinogenicity was seen in mice. Renal liposarcomas were observed in 4/100 rats (3 males, 1 female) receiving 80 mg/kg/day, and a renal lipoma was observed in one male rat at the 18 mg/kg/day dose. Incidence rates of lipoma and liposarcoma for zolpidem were similar to those seen in historical control cases, and the tumor findings are presumed to be a spontaneous occurrence, not causally related to zolpidem [FDA label].

**Mutagenesis**

Zolpidem did not show mutagenic activity in several tests including the Ames test, genotoxicity in mouse lymphoma cells in vitro, chromosomal aberrations in cultured human lymphocytes, abnormal DNA synthesis in rat hepatocytes in vitro, and the micronucleus test performed in mice [FDA label].

**Impairment of fertility**

In a rat reproduction study, the high dose (100 mg base/kg) of zolpidem lead to irregular estrus cycles and prolonged precoital intervals, however, there was no effect on male or female fertility after daily oral doses comparable to 5 to 130 times the recommended human dose. No effects on any other fertility parameters were observed [FDA label]. 

**Use in pregnancy**

This drug is considered a pregnancy category C drug.  There are currently no sufficient conclusive studies completed in pregnant women to determine the safety of zolpidem use during pregnancy. Zolpidem should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus.

**Use in nursing**

Deaths were largely resulting from cardiovascular, such as heart failure and sudden death, or infectious, such as pneumonia, conditions.[label] Due to its antagonist action on dopamine receptors, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for developing extrapyramidal symptoms such as tardive dyskinesia, which is a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements. This risk is also conferred on other antipsychotic agents that block dopamine receptors. It is proposed that increased duration of the drug treatment is likely thus increased total cumulative dose of antipsychotic drugs administered to the patient leads to increased risk for developing the syndrome and the likelihood that it will become irreversible. As with other antipsychotic agents, prochlorperazine is associated with a risk for causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), which is a potentially fatal symptom complex, which is manifested as hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability. 

There is no known antidote for prochlorperazine thus overdose treatment should be supportive and symptomatic. Overdose of prochlorperazine may produce dystonic reactions that involve extrapyramidal mechanism. To reduce these symptoms, antiparkinsonism drugs, barbiturates, or diphenhydramine may be used. Symptoms of central nervous system depression, such as somnolence or coma, may also be observed. Amphetamine, destroamphetamine, or caffeine and sodium benzoate may be used to induce stimulatory effects. In contrast, agitation and restlessness may also be seen in case of overdose. Other possible manifestations include convulsions, EKG changes and cardiac arrhythmias, fever, and autonomic reactions such as hypotension, dry mouth and ileus. Hypotension can be responded with the standard measures for managing circulatory shock.[label] 

**Nonclinical Toxicology**

In a rat developmental or reproductive toxicity study, abnormalities in both the reproductive measures and neurobehavioral testing were observed following administration of 25 mg/kg of prochlorperazine.[L6649] 

**Use in specific populations**

As the use of antipsychotic agents during the third trimester of pregnancy is associated with a risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery, the use of prochlorperazine in pregnant patients is generally not recommended and it should be limited after careful consideration of the potential benefit of drug therapy justifying the potential risk to the fetus. Caution should be exercised when prochlorperazine is administered to a nursing mother. While lower doses of prochlorperazine is reported to be safe for elderly patients, caution is still advised, especially those with higher susceptibility to hypotension and neuromuscular reactions.[label]","Indicated for the symptomatic treatment of severe nausea and vomiting.[label]

Indicated for the management of manifestations of psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and generalized non-psychotic anxiety. The use of prochlorperazine for the management of generalized non-psychotic anxiety is typically not a first-line therapy and should be limited to doses of less than 20 mg per day or for shorter than 12 weeks.[label,L6634]

Off-label uses include use in emergency settings for adult and pediatric migraines. The American Headache Society recommends the use of prochlorperazine as the first-line medication in this setting. In pediatric migraines, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent is often used in combination with dopamine antagonist.[L6637]"

**Use in pregnancy**

Reproductive studies have been completed using rats and rabbit models at doses up to twenty times the normal human dose ( about 5 mg/kg per day), and it was concluded that fertility was not impaired and there was no fetal harm. There is a published report of a study in pregnant mice administered 50 or 100 mg/kg allopurinol intraperitoneally on gestation days 10 or 13. There were increased numbers of dead fetuses in dams administered 100 mg/kg allopurinol, however, death did not occur in those given 50 mg/kg. There were higher numbers of external malformations in fetuses at both doses of allopurinol on gestation day 10 and higher numbers of skeletal malformations in fetuses at both doses on gestation day 13. Despite the above findings, there are no adequate or well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if it is absolutely required [FDA label]. 

**Use in nursing**

Both allopurinol and the metabolite oxipurinol have been found in the milk of a mother who was receiving allopurinol. Since the effect of allopurinol on the nursing infant is unknown, it is advisable to exercise caution when allopurinol is taken by a nursing woman [FDA label]. 

**Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity**

Cytogenic studies demonstrate that allopurinol does not induce chromosomal abnormalities in human blood cells in vitro at concentrations up to 100 g/mL and in vivo at doses up to 60 mg/day for an average duration of 40 months. Allopurinol does not form nitroso compounds (which may be carcinogenic) or affect lymphocyte transformation in vitro. Evidence suggests that allopurinol does not have deleterious effects on DNA at any stage of the cell cycle and was not found to be mutagenic. No evidence of carcinogenicity has been observed in mice treated with allopurinol for up to a 2 year period [F3988]. ","Allopurinol is indicated in [FDA label]:

2) the management of patients with leukemia, lymphoma and malignancies who are receiving cancer therapy which causes elevations of serum and urinary uric acid levels. Treatment with allopurinol should be discontinued when the potential for overproduction of uric acid is no longer present.

3) the management of patients with recurrent calcium oxalate calculi whose daily uric acid excretion exceeds 800 mg/day in male patients and 750 mg/day in female patients.

DB00470,"SYNDROS, a synthetic cannabinoid containing alcohol, may cause fetal harm. Avoid the use of SYNDROS in pregnant women. Although there is little published data on the use of synthetic cannabinoids during pregnancy, the use of cannabis (e.g., marijuana) and the use of alcohol during pregnancy have been associated with adverse fetal/neonatal outcomes (see Clinical Considerations). Cannabinoids have been found in the umbilical cord blood of pregnant women who smoke cannabis. In animal reproduction studies, no teratogenicity was reported in mice administered dronabinol (delta-9-THC) at up to 30 times the MRHD (maximum recommended human doses) and up to 5 times the MRHD for patients with AIDS and cancer, respectively. Similar findings were reported in pregnant rats administered dronabinol at up to 5 to 20 times the MRHD and 3 times the MRHD for patients with AIDS and cancer, respectively.
Decreased maternal weight gain and the number of viable pups and increased fetal mortality and early resorptions were observed in both species at doses that induced maternal toxicity. In rats, maternal administration of dronabinol from pregnancy (implantation) through weaning was associated with maternal toxicity, including mortality of pups, and adverse developmental and 10 neurodevelopmental effects on the pups at 2 to 20 times the MRHD for patients with AIDS and less than and up to 3.3 times the MRHD for patients with cancer.[L43438]

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.[L43438]

For mothers infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that HIV-infected mothers not breastfeed their infants to avoid risking postnatal transmission of HIV. Because of the potential for HIV transmission (in 12 HIV-negative infants) and serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, instruct mothers not to breastfeed if they are receiving SYNDROS. For mothers with nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy, there are limited data on the presence of dronabinol in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The reported effects of inhaled cannabis transferred to the breastfeeding infant have been inconsistent and insufficient to establish causality. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for SYNDROS and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from SYNDROS or from the underlying maternal condition.[L43438] 

The safety and effectiveness of SYNDROS have not been established in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients may be more sensitive to the neurological and psychoactive effects of SYNDROS. SYNDROS contains the excipients 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol and 5.5% (w/w) propylene glycol. Ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene glycol, which may lead to elevated concentrations of propylene glycol. Preterm neonates may be at increased risk of propylene glycol-associated adverse events due to
diminished ability to metabolize propylene glycol, thereby, leading to accumulation.[L43438]

Clinical studies of dronabinol capsules in AIDS and cancer patients did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the neuropsychiatric and postural hypotensive effects of SYNDROS. Elderly patients with dementia are at increased risk for falls as a result of their underlying disease state, which may be exacerbated by the CNS effects of somnolence and dizziness associated with
SYNDROS. These patients should be monitored closely and placed on fall precautions prior to initiating SYNDROS therapy. In antiemetic studies, no difference in efficacy was apparent in patients greater than 55 years of age compared to younger
patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of falls decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, increased sensitivity to psychoactive effects, and concomitant disease or other drugs therapy.[L43438]

SYNDROS contains dronabinol, the main psychoactive component in marijuana. Ingestion of high doses of dronabinol increases the risk of psychiatric adverse reactions if abused or misused, while continued administration can lead to addiction. Psychiatric adverse reactions may include psychosis, hallucinations, depersonalization, mood alteration, and paranoia. In vitro studies demonstrate that SYNDROS can be easily and effectively abused without manipulation. SYNDROS contains 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol. In a randomized, single-dose, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled crossover pharmacodynamic study of 43 experienced marijuana smokers, “drug liking” responses and safety of SYNDROS were compared with placebo and dronabinol in sesame oil oral capsules. Treatment arms were 10 mg and 30 mg dronabinol capsules, 10 mg and 30 mg dronabinol from= SYNDROS, and placebo oral solution and capsules. Greater “drug liking” scores were reported with the 30 mg dose, compared with the 10 mg dose, for both SYNDROS and dronabinol-containing capsules. Overall, the pharmacodynamic results from this study demonstrated no statistically significant differences in various measures of drug liking for the doses taken, though the SYNDROS results were consistently greater than those of dronabinol capsules. Similarly, observed adverse reactions were greater for SYNDROS. The pharmacodynamic and safety effects of SYNDROS following multiple doses have not been evaluated. Patients should be instructed to keep SYNDROS in a secure place out of reach of others for whom the medication has not been prescribed.[L43438] 

Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use. Physical dependence manifests by drug class-specific withdrawal symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug. The appearance of a withdrawal syndrome when the administration of the drug is terminated is the only actual evidence
of physical dependence. Physical dependence can develop during chronic therapy with SYNDROS and develops after chronic abuse of marijuana. A withdrawal syndrome was reported after the abrupt discontinuation of dronabinol capsules in subjects receiving dosages of 210 mg per day for 12 to 16 consecutive days. Within 12 hours after discontinuation, subjects manifested symptoms such as irritability, insomnia, and restlessness. By approximately 24 hours post-dronabinol discontinuation, withdrawal symptoms
intensified to include “hot flashes”, sweating, rhinorrhea, loose stools, hiccoughs, and anorexia. These withdrawal symptoms gradually dissipated over the next 48 hours. Electroencephalographic changes consistent with the effects of drug withdrawal (hyperexcitation) were recorded in patients after abrupt dechallenge. Patients also complained of disturbed sleep for several weeks after discontinuing therapy with high dosages of dronabinol.[L43438]

Signs and symptoms of dronabinol overdose include drowsiness, euphoria, heightened sensory awareness, altered time perception, reddened conjunctiva, dry mouth, tachycardia, memory impairment, depersonalization, mood alteration, urinary retention, reduced bowel motility, decreased motor coordination, lethargy, slurred speech, and postural hypotension. Patients may also experience panic reactions if they have a prior history of nervousness or anxiety and seizures may occur in patients with existing seizure disorders. It is not known if dronabinol can be removed by dialysis in cases of overdose.[L43438]

Moreover, when employed for such indications montelukast is considered effective as monotherapy or when combined with other medications indicated for the maintenance treatment of chronic asthma.[L6304,L6328] For instance, montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids can be used concomitantly to demonstrate additive effects to control asthma or to decrease the necessary inhaled corticosteroid dose while still maintaining clinical stability.[L6304,L6328]

Additionally, in patients who continue to experience asthma symptoms, montelukast can also be combined with an 'as required' short-acting beta-agonist, an inhaled corticosteroid, or inhaled corticosteroid paired with a long-acting beta-agonist.[L6304,L6328]"
DB00472,"In a report that included 234 fluoxetine overdose cases, it was concluded that symptoms resulting from fluoxetine overdose were generally minor and short in duration.[A181898] The most common overdose adverse effects included drowsiness, tremor, tachycardia, nausea and vomiting, and providing the patient with aggressive supportive care was the recommended intervention.[A181892][A181898]

Despite this evidence, more severe adverse effects have been linked to fluoxetine ingestion although most of these reports involved co-ingestion with other substances or drugs as well as other factors.[A181892] For example, there is a case report that details a patient who ingested 1400 mg of fluoxetine in a suicide attempt and as a result, experienced a generalized seizure three hours later.[A181892] In a separate case, a 14 year old patient ingested 1.2 g of fluoxetine and subsequently experienced tonic/clonic seizures, symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis, although the patient did not experience sustained renal injury.[A182216]","Fluoxetine is indicated for both acute and maintenance treatment of major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and bulimia nervosa; however, it is only indicated for acute treatment of panic disorder independent of whether agoraphobia is present.[L7664] Fluoxetine may also be used in combination with olanzapine to treat depression related to Bipolar I Disorder, and treatment resistant depression.[L7664] Fluoxetine is additionally indicated for the treatment of female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).[L40833]"

**Nephrotoxicity** 

Mild and reversible nephrotoxicity may be observed in 5 - 25% of patients. Amikacin accumulates in the proximal renal tubular cells. Tubular cell regeneration occurs despite continued drug exposure. Toxicity most commonly occurs several days following initiation of therapy. Amikacin may exacerbate pre-existing renal disease.[Label]

**Ototoxicity**

May cause irreversible ototoxicity.[Label] Ototoxicity appears to be correlated to cumulative exposure. Drug accumulation in the endolymph and perilymph of the inner ear causes irreversible damage to hair cells of the cochlea or summit of ampullar cristae in the vestibular complex. High- frequency hearing is lost first with progression leading to loss of low-frequency hearing. Further toxicity may lead to retrograde degeneration of the 8th cranial (vestibulocochlear) nerve. Vestibular toxicity may cause vertigo, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and loss of balance.[F1949,Label]

In addition to the above, amikacin may exacerbate neuromuscular blockade, however, this is less common.[Label,L4680]

**Use in Pregnancy**

Category D. Gentamicin and other aminoglycosides are known to cross the placenta. There is evidence of selective uptake of gentamicin by the fetal kidney resulting in damage to immature nephrons. Eighth cranial nerve damage has also been reported after in-utero exposure to some of the aminoglycosides. Because of the chemical similarity, all aminoglycosides should be considered potentially nephrotoxic and ototoxic to the developing fetus. Therapeutic blood amikacin levels in the mother do not equate with safety for the fetus. In reproductive toxicity studies in mice and rats, no effects on fertility or fetal toxicity were observed.[F1949]

**Use in Lactation**

It is not known whether amikacin is excreted in breast milk. Since the possible harmful effect on the infant is not known, it is recommended that if nursing mothers must be given amikacin, the infants should not be breastfed during therapy.[F1949]","The amikacin sulfate injection is indicated in the short-term treatment of serious bacterial infections due to susceptible strains of gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas species, Escherichia coli, species of indole-positive and indole-negative Proteus, Providencia species, Klebsiella-Enterobacter-Serratia species, as well as Acinetobacter (Mima-Herellea) species.[F1954]

Clinical studies have shown amikacin sulfate injection to be effective in bacterial septicemia (including neonatal sepsis); in serious infections of the respiratory tract, bones and joints, central nervous system (including meningitis) and skin and soft tissue; intra-abdominal infections (including peritonitis); and in burns and postoperative infections (including post-vascular surgery).[F1954]

Clinical studies have shown amikacin also to be effective in serious, complicated, and recurrent urinary tract infections due to the above organisms. Aminoglycosides, including amikacin, are not indicated in uncomplicated first-time episodes of urinary tract infections unless the causative organisms are not susceptible to antibiotics which are less toxic.[F1954]

In September 2018, a new indication with a new dosage route was approved for this drug. Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension was approved for the treatment of lung disease caused by a group of bacteria, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in a limited population of patients with the disease who do not respond to conventional treatment (refractory disease).[L4673] This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on achieving sputum culture conversion (defined as 3 consecutive negative monthly sputum cultures) by Month 6 of treatment. Clinical benefit has not yet been established.[Label]

**Important notes regarding Staphylococcus and Sensitivity testing:**

Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is the principal Gram-positive organism sensitive to amikacin.
The use of amikacin in the treatment of staphylococcal infections should be restricted only to second-line therapy, and should be limited to only those patients suffering from severe infections caused by susceptible strains of staphylococcus species who have failed to show sensitivity to other available antibiotics.[F1949]

Bacteriologic studies should be performed to identify causative organisms and their susceptibilities to amikacin. Amikacin may be used as initial therapy in suspected gram-negative infections and therapy may be initiated before obtaining the results of susceptibility testing.[Label,F1949,F1954]"

**Nonclinical Toxicology**

In a two-year mouse carcinogenicity study at raloxifene doses that are higher than the human therapeutic doses, there was an increased incidence of benign and malignant ovarian tumors of granulosa or theca cell origin. Another study showed an increased incidence of testicular interstitial cell tumors, prostatic adenomas, adenocarcinomas, and prostatic leiomyoblastoma in male mice receiving doses higher than human therapeutic doses. There was no evidence of the genotoxic potential of raloxifene in bacterial mutagenicity assays, _in vitro_ rat DNA assays, or other _in vitro_ rodent cell line assays. When assessing effects on the reproductive system of male and female rats, raloxifene caused lack of pregnancy and disruptions in estrous cycles and inhibited ovulation at dose of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg/day. Administration of raloxifene during the preimplantation period at doses greater than 0.1 mg/kg resulted in delayed and disrupted embryo implantation, further leading to prolonged gestation and reduced litter size. There were no effects on sperm production or quality or reproductive performance in male rats. The effects on the fertility by raloxifene were reversible.[label]

This result contrasts with the finding in a planned 1-year dog study that was prematurely terminated because of deaths associated with convulsions in dogs receiving as little as 0.5mg/kg/day. The earliest deaths, however, occurred at 56 days in dogs receiving 2mg/kg/day. The unusual vulnerability of the dog is not understood; it is hypothesised, however, that the explanation lies in the fact that the dog differs markedly from other species (including humans) in its metabolism of Nabilone.",Nabilone is indicated for the treatment of the nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments.

Conversely, the most common adverse effects associated with vancomycin appear to be nausea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia [FDA Label]. In particular, incidences of hypokalemia, urinary tracy infection, peripheral edema, insomnia, constipation, anemia, depression, vomiting, and hypotension are higher among subjects >65 years of than in those that are 65 years old or younger [FDA Label].

Additionally, nephrotoxicity involving reports of renal failure, renal impairment, elevated blood creatinine, and others has also occurred with vancomycin therapy during studies, and can occur during or after completion of a course of therapy [FDA Label]. Risk of such nephrotoxicity is increased in patients greater than 65 years of age [FDA Label].

Ototoxicity has also occurred in patients receiving vancomycin treatment, and it can be transient or permanent. This effect has been reported primarily in patients who have been given excessive intravenous doses, who have kidney dysfunction, who have an underlying hearing loss, or who are receiving concomitant therapy with another ototoxic agent like an aminoglycoside [FDA Label]. Potentially related adverse effects like vertigo, dizziness, and tinnitus have also been reported [FDA Label].

Neutropenia, often beginning one week or more after onset of intravenous vancomycin therapy or after a total dose of more than 25 mg has been observed for several dozen patients as well. This neutropenia however, appears to be promptly reversible when the vancomycin treatment is discontinued. Alternatively, thrombocytopenia has also been reported [FDA Label].

Additionally, a condition has been reported that is described as being similar to IV-induced symptoms involving symptoms consistent with anaphylactoid reactions, including hypotension, wheezing, dyspnea, urticaria, pruritus, flushing of the upper body (in what is known as the so-called 'Red Man Syndrome'), pain and muscle spasm of the chest and back. Although on average such reactions usually resolve within 20 minutes, they are just as likely to persist for hours [FDA Label, A760].

In a controlled clinical study, the potential ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects of vancomycin on infants were assessed when the drug was given intravenously to pregnant women for serious staphylococcal infections complicating intravenous drug abuse. The results obtained demonstrated that vancomycin was found in cord blood but that no sensorineural hearing loss or nephrotoxicity attributable to vancomycin was noted. Ultimately however, because the number of subjects treated in this study was limited and vancomycin was administered only in the second and third trimesters, it is not formally known whether vancomycin causes fetal harm. Subsequently, vancomycin should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed [FDA Label].

Although it is known that vancomycin is excreted in human milk based on information obtained from the intravenous administration of the medication, it is not known if vancomycin is excreted into human milk after oral administration. However, because of the overall potential for adverse events, caution must be exercised when vancomycin is given to a nursing woman and a decision must be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into consideration the importance of the drug to the mother [FDA Label].

The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been formally established [FDA Label].

Patients older than 65 years of age may take longer to respond to therapy compared to patients aged 65 year or younger. Vancomycin treatment in patients aged older than 65 years subsequently should not be discontinued or switched to an alternative treatment prematurely [FDA Label].

Furthermore, clinical studies have demonstrated that geriatric patients are at increased risk of developing nephrotoxicity following treatment with oral vancomycin, which can occur during or after completion of therapy. In patients aged older than 65 years, including those with normal renal function prior to treatment, renal function should be monitored during and following treatment with vancomycin to detect any potential vancomycin induced nephrotoxicity [FDA Label].","Administered intravenously, vancomycin is indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of septicemia, infective endocarditis, skin and skin structure infections, bone infections, and lower respiratory tract infections.[L41529] Administered orally, vancomycin is indicated in adult and pediatric patients for the treatment of _Clostridium difficile_-associated diarrhea and for enterocolitis caused by _Staphylococcus aureus_ (including methicillin-resistant strains).[L41534]"

Valacyclovir was noncarcinogenic in lifetime carcinogenicity assays at single daily gavage doses of valacyclovir giving plasma acyclovir concentrations equivalent to human levels in the mouse bioassay and 1.4 to 2.3 times human levels in the rat bioassay. No clinically significant difference in the incidence of tumors between treated and control animals was observed, and valacyclovir was not found to shorten the latency period of tumors. Valacyclovir was tested in 5 genetic toxicity assays. An Ames assay was negative in the absence or presence of metabolic activation. An in vitro cytogenetic study with human lymphocytes and a rat cytogenetic study was negative [FDA label].

In the mouse lymphoma assay, valacyclovir was not found to be mutagenic without metabolic activation, however, in the presence of metabolic activation (76% to 88% conversion to acyclovir), valacyclovir was mutagenic. Valacyclovir was also found to be mutagenic in a mouse micronucleus assay [FDA label]. 

Valacyclovir did not impair fertility or reproduction in rats at 6 times the normal concentrations in human plasma [FDA label]. 

**Use in pregnancy**

Valacyclovir is categorized as a pregnancy category B drug. There are insufficient well-controlled studies of valacyclovir in pregnant women. The general rate of birth defects in infants exposed to acyclovir in-utero is comparable to the rate for infants measured in the general population. This drug should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the possible fetal risk [FDA label].

**Use in nursing**

Acyclovir, a major metabolite of valacyclovir, was excreted in breastmilk at lower concentrations when a normal therapeutic dose of valacyclovir was administered.   Exercise caution when acyclovir is used while nursing [FDA label]. 


**A note on renal function and toxicity in elderly patients**

Elderly patients and patients with decreased renal function are at increased risk of valacyclovir toxicity, which can sometimes lead to central nervous system effects, such as encephalopathy, agitation, dysarthria, mania, and psychosis, among other effects.  Consider reducing the dose of this drug in these populations to decrease the risk of toxicity [FDA label]. ","Valacyclovir is a nucleoside analog DNA polymerase inhibitor indicated for [FDA label]:

Oral LD<sub>50</sub> in rats is 2973 mg/kg.[MSDS] Lethality was observed with single oral doses of enalapril above 1000 mg/kg in mice and greater than or equal to 1775 mg/kg in rats. Serum enalaprilat levels 100- and 200-fold higher than usually seen after therapeutic doses have been reported after ingestion of 300 mg and 440 mg of enalapril, respectively.[L6586] While there is limited data about enalapril overdose in humans, overdosage may result in marked hypotension and stupor based on the pharmacological properties of the drug. Most common adverse effects of enalapril include cough, hypotension, stupor, headache, dizziness and fatigue. If hypotension is seen, usual treatment of intravenous infusion of normal saline solution is recommended. Enalaprilat may be removed from systemic circulation with the use of hemodialysis. It has been removed from neonatal circulation by peritoneal dialysis.[label]

**Nonclinical toxicology**

Maternal and fetal toxicity occudred in some rabbits treated with enalapril at doses of 1 mg/kg/day or more. There was no fetotoxicity, expressed as a decrease in average fetal weight, or teratogenicity in rats treated with enalapril at doses up to 200 mg/kg/day, which is about 333 times the maximum human dose.[L6586] In mice and rats receiving enalapril at doses ranging from 90 to 180 mg/kg/day, there was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect. Neither enalapril or its active metabolite were shown to be mutagenic or genotoxic in _in vitro_ and _in vivo_ studies. There were no adverse effects on reproductive performance of male and female rats treated with up to 90 mg/kg/day of enalapril. [label]

**Use in special populations**

Caution is warranted in patients who are concurrently using another ACE inhibitors with enalapril, as there have been incidences of agranulocytosis with the use of captopril, which is another ACE inhibitor. This adverse event may be particularly significant in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease.[label] As enalapril and enalaprilat were shown to be secreted in human milk in trace amounts, the use of enalaprilat in nursing women is not recommended.[L6586] Significant fetal transfer occurs with enalapril and enalaprilat thus the use of the drug in pregnant women should be strongly avoided. Caution is advised when enalapril is used in patients who are elderly or with renal impairment, as dosage adjustments may be appropriate.

In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study administration of imatinib at 15, 30, and 60 mg/kg/day resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the longevity of males at 60 mg/kg/day and females at greater than or equal to 30 mg/kg/day. Target organs for neoplastic changes were the kidneys (renal tubule and renal pelvis), urinary bladder, urethra, preputial and clitoral gland, small intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, and non-glandular stomach. Neoplastic lesions were not seen at 30 mg/kg/day for the kidneys, urinary bladder, urethra, small intestine, parathyroid glands, adrenal glands, and non-glandular stomach, and 15 mg/kg/day for the preputial and clitoral gland. The papilloma/carcinoma of the preputial/clitoral gland was noted at 30 and 60 mg/kg/day, representing approximately 0.5 to 4 or 0.3 to 2.4 times the human daily exposure (based on AUC) at 400 mg/day or 800 mg/day, respectively, and 0.4 to 3.0 times the daily exposure in children (based on AUC) at 340 mg/m2. The renal tubule adenoma/carcinoma, renal pelvis transitional cell neoplasms, the urinary bladder and urethra transitional cell papillomas, the small intestine adenocarcinomas, the parathyroid glands adenomas, the benign and malignant medullary tumors of the adrenal glands and the non-glandular stomach papillomas/carcinomas were noted at 60 mg/kg/day. The relevance of these findings in the rat carcinogenicity study for humans is not known. Positive genotoxic effects were obtained for imatinib in an in vitro mammalian cell assay (Chinese hamster ovary) for clastogenicity (chromosome aberrations) in the presence of metabolic activation. Two intermediates of the manufacturing process, which are also present in the final product, are positive for mutagenesis in the Ames assay. One of these intermediates was also positive in the mouse lymphoma assay. Imatinib was not genotoxic when tested in an in vitro bacterial cell assay (Ames test), an in vitro mammalian cell assay (mouse lymphoma) and an in vivo rat micronucleus assay.[L42080]

In a study of fertility, male rats were dosed for 70 days prior to mating and female rats were dosed 14 days prior to mating and through to gestational Day 6. Testicular and epididymal weights and percent motile sperm were decreased at 60 mg/kg, approximately three-fourths the maximum clinical dose of 800 mg/day based on BSA. This was not seen at doses less than or equal to 20 mg/kg (one-fourth of the maximum human dose of 800 mg). The fertility of male and female rats was not affected.[L42080] 

Fertility was not affected in the preclinical fertility and early embryonic development study although lower testes and epididymal weights, as well as a reduced number of motile sperm, were observed in the high-dose male rats. In the preclinical pre-and postnatal study in rats, fertility in the first generation offspring was also not affected by imatinib
mesylate.[L42080]

It is important to consider potential toxicities suggested by animal studies, specifically, liver, kidney, and cardiac toxicity and immunosuppression. Severe liver toxicity was observed in dogs treated for 2 weeks, with elevated liver enzymes, hepatocellular necrosis, bile duct necrosis, and bile duct hyperplasia. Renal toxicity was observed in monkeys treated for 2 weeks, with focal mineralization and dilation of the renal tubules and tubular nephrosis. Increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine were observed in several of these animals. An increased rate of opportunistic infections was observed with chronic imatinib treatment in laboratory animal studies. In a 39-week monkey study, treatment with imatinib resulted in the worsening of normally suppressed malarial infections in these animals. Lymphopenia was observed in animals (as in humans). Additional long-term toxicities were identified in a 2-year rat study. Histopathological examination of the treated rats that died in the study revealed cardiomyopathy (both sexes), chronic progressive nephropathy (females), and preputial gland papilloma as principal causes of death or reasons for sacrifice. Non-neoplastic lesions seen in this 2-year study that were not identified in earlier preclinical studies were the cardiovascular system, pancreas, endocrine organs, and teeth. The most important changes included cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation, leading to signs of cardiac insufficiency in some animals.[L42080]","Imatinib is indicated for the treatment of adult and pediatric chronic myeloid leukemia with Philadelphia chromosome mutation (Ph+) in blast crisis, accelerated phase, or chronic phase after IFN-alpha therapy failure.[L42080] Additionally, imatinib is also indicated to treat adult and pediatric Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia, adult myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases, adult aggressive systemic mastocytosis, adult hypereosinophilic syndrome and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), adult dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and malignant gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).[L42080]

**Pregnancy**

Epinephrine is teratogenic in rats when given in doses about 25 times the human doses. It is unknown whether epinephrine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Epinephrine should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly required in critical situations/emergencies [F2136].

**Labor and Delivery**
Parenteral administration of epinephrine, if used as support for blood pressure during low or other spinal anesthesia for delivery, can lead to the acceleration of fetal heart rate and should not be used in obstetrics when maternal blood pressure is higher than 130/80. Epinephrine may delay the second stage of labour.

**Common and generalized adverse effects**:
Transient and minor side effects of anxiety, headache, fear, and palpitations may occur with therapeutic doses of epinephrine, especially in hyperthyroid individuals. Repeated local injections may result in necrosis at sites of injection due to vascular constriction. Cerebral hemorrhage; hemiplegia; subarachnoid hemorrhage; anginal pain in patients with angina pectoris; anxiety; restlessness; throbbing headache; tremor; weakness; dizziness; pallor; respiratory difficulty; palpitation; apprehensiveness; sweating; nausea; vomiting [FDA label].

**Cardiovascular effects:** Inadvertently induced high arterial blood pressure may result in angina pectoris (especially when coronary insufficiency is present), cardiac ischemia, or aortic rupture [FDA label], [L4825]. Epinephrine may cause serious cardiac arrhythmias in patients not suffering from heart disease and patients with organic heart disease receiving drugs that sensitize the cardiac muscle. With the injection of epinephrine 1:1,000, a paradoxical but transient lowering of blood pressure, bradycardia and apnea may occur immediately post-injection [FDA label].

**Cerebrovascular hemorrhage**: Overdosage or accidental I.V. injection of epinephrine may lead to cerebrovascular hemorrhage resulting from the sharp rise in blood pressure [FDA label].

**Renal vasoconstriction**:  Parenterally administered epinephrine initially may produce constriction of renal blood vessels and decrease urine formation. High doses may cause complete renal shutdown [F2136].

**Pulmonary edema**: Fatality may also result from pulmonary edema due to the peripheral constriction and cardiac stimulation produced by epinephrine injection [FDA label].

**Digital vasoconstriction**: Since epinephrine is a strong vasoconstrictor, accidental injection into the digits, hands or feet may lead to the loss of blood flow to the affected area. Treatment should be directed at vasodilation in addition to further treatment of anaphylaxis [FDA label].


","Epinephrine injection and nasal spray are indicated in the emergency treatment of type I allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis.[L41260, L51798] Epinephrine injection is also used to increase mean arterial blood pressure in adult patients with hypotension associated with septic shock.[L41260]

Epinephrine's cardiac effects may be of use in restoring cardiac rhythm in cardiac arrest due to various causes but is not used in cardiac failure or in hemorrhagic, traumatic, or cardiogenic shock [F1247].

Epinephrine is used as a hemostatic agent. It is so used in treating mucosal congestion of hay fever, rhinitis, and acute sinusitis; to relieve bronchial asthmatic paroxysms; in syncope due to complete heart block or carotid sinus hypersensitivity; for symptomatic relief of serum sickness, urticaria, angioneurotic edema; for resuscitation in cardiac arrest following anesthetic accidents; in simple (open-angle) glaucoma; for relaxation of uterine musculature and to inhibit uterine contractions. Epinephrine injection can be utilized to prolong the action of local anesthetics [F1247].

In addition to the above, epinephrine is used as an over the counter (OTC) agent for the intermittent symptoms of asthma, such as wheezing, tightness of chest and shortness of breath [F2131].  It is also used for the maintenance of mydriasis during intraocular surgery [L4825]."

**Overdose**

Doses of 1-2 mg/kg/day over a period of 15 days have been fatal in humans.[L6625] Warfarin overdose is primarily associated with major bleeding particularly from the mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary system.[label,L6625] Epistaxis, ecchymoses, as well as renal and hepatic bleeding are also associated. These symptoms become apparent within 2-4 days of overdose although increases in prothrombin time can be observed within 24 hours. Treatment for overdosed patients includes discontinuation of warfarin and administration of [vitamin K]. For more urgent reversal of anticoagulation [prothrombin] complex concentrate, blood plasma, or [coagulation factor VIIa] infusion can be used.[label] Patients can be safely re-anticoagulated after reversal of the overdose.

**Carcinogenicity & Mutagenicity**

The carcinogenicity and mutagenicity of warfarin have not been thoroughly investigated.[label]

**Reproductive Toxicity**

Warfarin is known to be a teratogen and its use during pregnancy is contraindicated in the absence of high thrombotic risk.[label,L6625] Fetal warfarin syndrome, attributed to exposure during the 1st trimester, is characterized by nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses, possible failure of nasal septum development, and low birth weight. Either dorsal midline dysplasia or ventral midline dysplasia can occur. Dorsal midline dysplasia includes agenisis of the corpus callosum, Dandy-Walker malformations, midline cerebellar hypoplasia. Ventral midline dysplasia is characterized by eye anomalies which can potentially include optic atrophy, blindness, and microphthalmia. Exposure during the 2nd and 3rd trimester is associated with hypoplasia of the extremities, developmental retardation, microcephaly, hydrocephaly, schizencephaly, seizures, scoliosis, deafness, congenital heart malformations, and fetal death. The critical exposure period is estimated to be week 6-9 based on case reports. Effects noted in the Canadian product monograph include developing a single kidney, asplenia, anencephaly, spina bifida, cranial nerve palsy, polydactyl malformations, corneal leukoma, diaphragm hernia, and cleft palate.[L6616]

**Lactation**

Official product monographs mention a study in 15 women.[label,L6616] Warfarin was not detected in the breast milk of any woman and 6 infants were documented as having normal prothrombin times. The remaining 9 infants were not tested. Another study in 13 women using doses of 2-12 mg also revealed no detectable warfarin in breast milk.[L6628] A woman who mistakenly took 25 mg of warfarin for 7 days while breastfeeding presented to an emergency room with an INR of 10 and prothrombin time of over 100 s. Her infant had a normal INR of 1.0 and prothrombin time of 10.3. The infant in this case has an increased prothrombin time of 33.8 s three weeks previous but this was judged not to be due to warfarin exposure.","**Indicated** for:[label,L6616]

**Overdose**

Signs of overdose include sedation, somnolence, confusion, impaired coordination, diminished reflexes, coma, and deleterious effects on vital signs.  Serious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred, sometimes ending in death or permanent neurologic effects, after the administration of midazolam.[FDA label]

**A note on cardiac and respiratory depression**

After administration of midazolam, continuous monitoring of respiratory and cardiac function is recommended until the patient is in stable condition. Serious and life-threatening cardiorespiratory adverse reactions, including hypoventilation, airway obstruction, apnea, and hypotension have been reported with the use of midazolam. Patients should be monitored in a setting with immediate access to resuscitative drugs if they are required. Resuscitation equipment and personnel trained in their use and skilled in airway management should be available when midazolam is administered.[FDA label]

The usual recommended intramuscular pre-medicating doses of midazolam do not depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation to a clinically significant extent in adults. Intravenous induction doses of midazolam depress the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide stimulation for at least 15 minutes longer than the duration of ventilatory depression following administration of thiopental in adults. Impairment of ventilatory response to carbon dioxide is more severe in adult patients diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).[F2434]

**A note on dependence**

When midazolam is used in long-term sedation in the ICU (intensive care unit) or other settings, physical dependence on midazolam may develop. The risk of dependence increases with dose and duration of treatment; this risk is also greater in patients with a medical history of substance abuse.[L5074]

**Special caution should be exercised when administering midazolam in the following populations** 

High-risk patients include adults over 60 years of age, chronically ill or debilitated patients, which may include patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency, patients with chronic renal failure, impaired hepatic function or with impaired cardiac function, pediatric patients (especially those with cardiovascular instability). These high-risk patients require lower dosages and should be monitored on a continuous basis for early signs of alterations of vital functions, so that appropriate management may be administered.[L5074]

**Mutagenesis**

Midazolam was negative for genotoxicity during in vitro and in vivo assays.[FDA label]

**Impairment of Fertility**

When midazolam (0, 1, 4, or 16 mg/kg) was given orally to male and female rats before and during mating and continuing in females throughout gestation and lactation, no adverse effects on male or female fertility were observed. Midazolam plasma exposures (AUC) at the highest dose tested were approximately 6 times that in humans at the recomended human dose.[FDA label]","Midazolam has different indications depending on its formulation by the FDA. 

**Nasal** 

For the nasal spray formulation, midazolam is indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent, stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e., seizure clusters, acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient’s usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.[L44773] 

**Intravenous** 

For the intravenous injection formulation, midazolam is indicated as an agent for sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia and prior to or during diagnostic, therapeutic or endoscopic procedures, such as bronchoscopy, gastroscopy, cystoscopy, coronary angiography, cardiac catheterization, oncology procedures, radiologic procedures, suture of lacerations and other procedures either alone or in combination with other CNS depressants.[L12981] The sedative, anxiolytic and amnestic use of midazolam can also be employed pre-operatively.[L12981] It can also be indicated for induction of general anesthesia, before administration of other anesthetic agents or as a component of intravenous supplementation of nitrous oxide and oxygen for a balanced anesthesia.[L12981] A relatively narrower dose range of midazolam and a shorter period of induction can be achieved if midazolam is combined with narcotic premedication.[L12981] Finally, midazolam can be indicated as a continous intravenous infusion for sedation of intubated and mechanically ventilated patients as a component of anesthesia or during treatment in a critical care setting.[L12981]

**Intramuscular** 

For the intramusuclar injection formulation, midazolam is indicated for preoperative sedation/anxiolysis/amnesia or for treatment of status epilepticus in adults.[L12981,L45048]

**Oral**

Midazolam syrup is indicated for use in pediatric patients for sedation, anxiolysis and amnesia prior to diagnostic, therapeutic or endoscopic procedures or before induction of anesthesia. It is only approved in monitored settings only and not for chronic or home use.[L5092]

In Europe, a buccal formulation of midazolam is also approved for the treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures in infants, toddlers, children and adolescents (from 3 months to < 18 years). For infants between 3-6 months of age treatment should be in a hospital setting where monitoring is possible and resuscitation equipment is available.[L45053]

**Use in pregnancy**

Animal studies have determined that this drug causes fetal harm [FDA label]. Studies have not been performed in humans, and it is advisable to ensure that tizanidine use in pregnant women should be reserved for cases in which possible benefit clearly outweighs the possible risk to mother and unborn child [F4471]. 

**Use in breastfeeding**

In studies of rat models, this tizanidine was found excreted in the breastmilk with a milk-to-blood ratio of 1.8:1 [FDA label]. In young nursing rats, abnormal results were obtained in tests indicative of central nervous system function. Various developmental changes that may have been attributable to the drug were observed.  It is unknown whether tizanidine is excreted in human milk. It is a lipid-soluble drug, however, and likely to be excreted into breast milk [F4471]. 

**Carcinogenesis and mutagenesis**

No signs of carcinogenicity were observed in two dietary studies performed in rodent models. Tizanidine was given to mice for 78 weeks at doses reaching a maximum 16 mg/kg (equivalent to twice the maximum recommended human dose). In addition, the drug was given to rats for 104 weeks at doses reaching 9 mg/kg (equivalent to 2.5 times the maximum recommended human dose). There was a lack of a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of tumors in either study group [F4471].

Tizanidine was not found to be mutagenic or clastogenic in several laboratory essays, including the bacterial Ames test, the mammalian gene mutation test, in addition to the chromosomal aberration test in Chinese hamster cells and several other assays [F4471].

","Tizanidine is indicated for the relief of muscle spasticity, which can interfere with daily activities.  The general recommendation is to reserve tizanidine use for periods of time when there is a particular need for relief, as it has a short duration of action [FDA label, F4471]. "

**A Note on Respiratory Depression**

Major, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has been reported with the use of opioids, even in cases where it is used as recommended. Respiratory depression may lead to respiratory arrest and death if not diagnosed and treated appropriately. This drug should be administered only by persons specifically trained in the use of anesthetic drugs and the management of the respiratory effects of potent opioids, including respiration and cardiac resuscitation of patients in the age group being treated. This training must include the establishment and maintenance of a patent airway and assisted ventilation [FDA label].

**Carcinogenesis**
Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of sufentanil have not been conducted [FDA label].

**Mutagenesis**
Sufentanil was not found to be genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames assay) or in the in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleous assay [FDA label].

**Reproductive Toxicity**

Sufentanil caused embryolethality in rats and rabbits treated for 10-30 days during pregnancy with 2.5 times the maximum human dose by intravenous administration. The embryolethal effect was thought to be secondary to the toxicity for the mother animal model. No negative effects were noted in another study in rats that were treated with 20 times the maximum human dose in the period of organogenesis. The preclinical effects were only seen following administrations of levels significantly above the maximum human dose, which is therefore of minimal relevance for clinical use [F2009].

Clinical consequences of overdosage with gadobenate dimeglumine have not been reported. Treatment of an overdosage should be directed toward support of vital functions and prompt institution of symptomatic therapy.

Gadobenate dimeglumine had no effect on fertility and reproductive performance at IV doses of up to 2 mmol/kg/day (3 times the human dose on body surface basis) for 13 weeks in male rats and for 32 days in female rats. However, vacuolation in testes and abnormal spermatogenic cells were observed when gadobenate dimeglumine was intravenously administered to male rats at 3 mmol/kg/day (5 times the human dose on body surface basis) for 28 days. The effects were not reversible following 28-day recovery period.

**A note on duration of treatment**

Recommendations for treatment of menopausal symptoms changed drastically following the release of results and early termination of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies in 2002 as concerns were raised regarding estrogen use.[A31626] Specifically, the combined estrogen–progestin group was discontinued after about 5 years of follow up due to a statistically significant increase in invasive breast cancer and in cardiovascular events.[A31627] 

Following extensive critique of the WHI results, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is now recommended to be used only for a short period (for 3-5 years postmenopause) in low doses, and in women without a history of breast cancer or increased risk of cardiovascular or thromboembolic disease.[A31628] Estrogen for postmenopausal symptoms should always be given with a progestin component due to estrogen's stimulatory effects on the endometrium; in women with an intact uterus, unopposed estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of the endometrium which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and possibly cancer over the long-term.

DB00795,"Two-year oral carcinogenicity studies were conducted in male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice. Sulfasalazine was tested at 84 (496 mg/m2), 168 (991 mg/m2), and 337.5 (1991 mg/m2) mg/kg/day doses in rats. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of urinary bladder transitional cell papillomas was observed in male rats. In female rats, two (4%) of the 337.5 mg/kg rats had transitional cell papilloma of the kidney. The increased incidence of neoplasms in the urinary bladder and kidney of rats
was also associated with an increase in renal calculi formation and hyperplasia of transitional cell epithelium. For the mouse study, sulfasalazine was tested at 675 (2025 mg/m2), 1350 (4050 mg/m2), and 2700 (8100 mg/m2) mg/kg/day. The incidence of hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma in male and female mice was significantly greater than the control at all doses tested.[L39065]

Sulfasalazine did not show mutagenicity in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) and in L51784 mouse lymphoma cell assay at the HGPRT gene. However, sulfasalazine showed an equivocal mutagenic response in the micronucleus assay of mouse
and rat bone marrow and mouse peripheral RBC and in the sister chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberration, and micronucleus assays in lymphocytes obtained from humans.[L39065] 

Impairment of male fertility was observed in reproductive studies performed in rats at a dose of 800 mg/kg/day (4800 mg/m2). Oligospermia and infertility have been described in men treated with sulfasalazine. Withdrawal of the drug appears to reverse these effects.[L39065] 

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of sulfasalazine in pregnant women. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 6 times the human maintenance dose of 2 g/day based on body surface area and have revealed no evidence of impaired female fertility or harm to the fetus due to sulfasalazine. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.[L39065] 

There have been case reports of neural tube defects (NTDs) in infants born to mothers who were exposed to sulfasalazine during pregnancy, but the role of sulfasalazine in these defects has not been established. However, oral sulfasalazine inhibits the absorption and metabolism of folic acid which may interfere with folic acid supplementation (see Drug Interactions) and diminish the effect of periconceptional folic acid supplementation that has been shown to decrease the risk of NTDs.[L39065] 

A national survey evaluated the outcome of pregnancies associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In a group of 186 women treated with sulfasalazine alone or sulfasalazine and concomitant steroid therapy, the incidence of fetal morbidity and mortality was comparable to that for 245 untreated IBD pregnancies as well as to pregnancies in the general population. A study of 1,455 pregnancies associated with exposure to sulfonamides indicated that this group of drugs, including sulfasalazine, did
not appear to be associated with fetal malformation. A review of the medical literature covering 1,155 pregnancies in women with ulcerative colitis suggested that the outcome was similar to that expected in the general population.[L39065] 

No clinical studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of sulfasalazine on the growth development and functional maturation of children whose mothers received the drug during pregnancy.[L39065]

In most cases only observation of vital functions is required [F3157, F3160, L5188].

Extreme overdosage may lead to coma, areflexia, cardio-respiratory depression and apnoea, requiring appropriate countermeasures (ventilation, cardiovascular support) [F3157, F3160, L5188].

Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with severe chronic obstructive airways disease [F3157, F3160, L5188]. Severe effects in overdose also include rhabdomyolysis and hypothermia [L5188]. Overdose of benzodiazepines in combination with other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may be fatal and should be closely monitored [F3157].

In general, the use of diazepam in women of childbearing potential, and more specifically during known pregnancy, should be considered only when the clinical situation warrants the risk to the fetus [F3157]. The possibility that a woman of childbearing potential may be pregnant at the time of institution of therapy should be considered [F3157]. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [F3157]. Patients should also be advised that if they become pregnant during therapy or intend to become pregnant they should communicate with their physician about the desirability of discontinuing the drug [F3157].

Special care must be taken when diazepam is used during labor and delivery, as high single doses may produce irregularities in the fetal heart rate and hypotonia, poor sucking, hypothermia, and moderate respiratory depression in the neonates [F3157]. With newborn infants it must be remembered that the enzyme system involved in the breakdown of the drug is not yet fully developed (especially in premature infants) [F3157].

Diazepam passes into breast milk [F3157]. Breastfeeding is therefore not recommended in patients receiving diazepam [F3157].

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 months have not been established [F3157].

In elderly patients, it is recommended that the dosage be limited to the smallest effective amount to preclude the development of ataxia or oversedation (2 mg to 2.5 mg once or twice daily, initially to be increased gradually as needed and tolerated) [F3157]. Extensive accumulation of diazepam and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, has been noted following chronic administration of diazepam in healthy elderly male subjects. Metabolites of this drug are known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions may be greater in patients with impaired renal function [F3157]. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function [F3157].

Decreases in clearance and protein binding, and increases in volume of distribution and half-life has been reported in patients with cirrhosis [F3157]. In such patients, a 2- to 5- fold increase in mean half-life has been reported [F3157]. Delayed elimination has also been reported for the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam [F3157]. Benzodiazepines are commonly implicated in hepatic encephalopathy [F3157].

“Sudden blindness” (amaurosis) of 2 to 3 minutes duration plus severe constipation occurred in one patient that was administered 72 mg of ondansetron intravenously as a single dose [F3178, F3181, F3184].

Acute oral LD50 values have been reported as over 1.0 g/kg in humans, cats, and dogs, 0.92 g/kg - 1.48 g/kg in albino rats, 1.19 g/kg in guinea pigs, 1.1 g/kg in mice, and 1.8 g/kg in rabbit models [FDA label].

**Acute toxicity**

Salicylate toxicity is a problem that may develop with both acute and chronic salicylate exposure [A35408]. 
Multiple organ systems may be affected by salicylate toxicity, including the central nervous system, the pulmonary system, and the gastrointestinal system. Severe bleeding may occur. In the majority of cases, patients suffering from salicylate toxicity are volume-depleted at the time of presentation for medical attention. Fluid resuscitation should occur immediately and volume status should be monitored closely.  Disruptions in acid-base balance are frequent in ASA toxicity [A35408]. 

The acute toxicity of acetylsalicylic in animals has been widely studied. The signs of poisoning in rats from lethal doses are mild to severe gastroenteritis, hepatitis, nephritis, pulmonary edema, encephalopathy, shock and some toxic effects on other organs and tissues. Mortality has been observed following convulsions or cardiovascular shock. An important differentiating property between various animal species is the ability to vomit toxic doses. Humans, cats and dogs have this ability, but rodents or rabbits do not [FDA label].  

**Chronic toxicity and carcinogenesis**

Chronic ASA toxicity is frequently accompanied by atypical clinical presentations that may be similar to diabetic ketoacidosis, delirium, cerebrovascular accident (CVA), myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac failure. Plasma salicylate concentrations should be measured if salicylate intoxication is suspected, even if there no documentation available to suggest ASA was ingested. In older age, nephrotoxicity from salicylates increases, and the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage is increased, with higher rates of mortality [A32954]. It is also important to note that ASA toxicity may  occur even with close to normal serum concentrations. Prevention of chronic ASA includes the administration of smallest possible doses, avoidance of concurrent use of salicylate drugs, and therapeutic drug monitoring. Renal function should be regularly monitored and screening for gastrointestinal bleeding should be done at regular intervals [A32954]. 

Chronic toxicity studies were performed in rodents. ASA was administered at doses measured to be 2 to 20 times the maximum tolerated clinical dose to mice for up to one year. Negative dose-related effects were seen. These include decreased mean survival time, decreased number of births and progeny reaching an appropriate age for weaning. No evidence of carcinogenesis was found in 1-year studies [FDA label]. At daily doses of 0.24 g/kg/day given for 100 days to albino rats, ASA led to signs to excessive thirst, aciduria, diuresis, drowsiness, hyperreflexia, piloerection, changes in respiration, tachycardia, followed by soft stools, epistaxis, sialorrhea, dacryorrhea and mortality during hypothermic coma in the second study month [FDA label].

**Use in pregnancy and lactation**

While teratogenic effects were observed in animals nearly lethal doses,  no evidence suggests that this drug is teratogenic in humans [FDA label]. It is advisable, however, to avoid ASA use the first and second trimester of pregnancy, unless it is clearly required. If acetylsalicylic acid containing drugs are ingested by a patient attempting to conceive, or during the first and second trimester of pregnancy, the lowest possible dose at the shortest possible duration should be taken [FDA label]. This drug is contraindicated in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy [FDA label]. ","**Pain, fever, and inflammation**

Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), in the regular tablet form (immediate-release), is indicated to relieve pain, fever, and inflammation associated with many conditions, including the flu, the common cold, neck and back pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, tooth pain, sprains, fractures, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, bursitis, burns, and various injuries. It is also used for symptomatic pain relief after surgical and dental procedures [FDA label]. 

The _extra strength_ formulation of acetylsalicylic acid is also indicated for the management migraine pain with photophobia (sensitivity to light) and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound)[FDA label].

**Other indications**

ASA is also indicated for various other purposes, due to its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. These include: 

Reducing the risk of cardiovascular death in suspected cases of myocardial infarction (MI) [FDA label]. 

Reducing the risk of a first non-fatal myocardial infarction in patients, and for reducing the risk of morbidity and mortality in cases of unstable angina and in those who have had a prior myocardial infarction [FDA label].

For reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and to prevent atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (in conjunction with other treatments) [FDA label].

For the prevention of thromboembolism after hip replacement surgery [FDA label]. 

For decreasing platelet to platelet adhesion following carotid endarterectomy, aiding in the prevention of transient ischemic attacks (TIA) [FDA label].

Used for patients undergoing hemodialysis with a silicone rubber arteriovenous cannula inserted to prevent thrombosis at the insertion site [FDA Label]. 

**Important note regarding use of the extended-release formulation [F4405]**

In the setting of acute myocardial infarction, or before percutaneous interventions, the extended-release form of acetylsalicylic acid should not be used. Use immediate-release formulations in scenarios requiring rapid onset of action [Label, F4405]. The extended-release form is taken to decrease the incidence of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) for individuals diagnosed with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD), including patients with previous myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina or with chronic stable angina. Additionally, the extended-release form is used to decrease the risk of death and recurrent episodes of stroke in patients with a history of stroke or TIA [F4405].

Otoxicity occurs as a result of irreversible damage to hair cells of the cochlea and/or summit of the ampullar cristae in the vestibular complex caused drug accumulation in the endolymph and perilymph of the inner ear. Otoxicity appears to be correlated to total exposure and may be cumulative with further doses of aminoglycosides or other ototoxic drugs (e.g. cisplatin, furosemide).

Hydroxyurea can cause fetal harm based on findings from animal studies and the drug’s mechanism of action. There are no studies on the use of Hydroxyurea in pregnant women and limited available data on SIKLOS use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform drug-associated risks. Drugs that affect DNA synthesis, such as hydroxyurea, may be potential mutagenic agents. In animal reproduction studies, administration of hydroxyurea to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis produced embryotoxic and teratogenic effects at doses 0.8 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose on a mg/m² basis. In rats and rabbits, fetal malformations were observed with partially ossified cranial bones, absence of eye sockets, hydrocephaly, bipartite sternebrae, and missing lumbar vertebrae. Embryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fetal viability, reduced live
litter sizes, and developmental delays. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.[L49181] 

Acute mucocutaneous toxicity has been reported in patients receiving hydroxyurea at doses several times above the therapeutic dose. Soreness, violet erythema, edema on palms and soles followed by scaling of hand and feet, severe generalized hyperpigmentation of the skin, and stomatitis have been observed. In patients with sickle cell anemia, neutropenia was reported in isolated cases of hydroxyurea overdose (1.43 times and 8.57 times the maximum recommended dose of 35 mg/kg b.w./day). Monitor blood counts weekly until recovery. Treatment of overdose consists of gastric lavage, followed by symptomatic treatment and control of bone marrow function.[L49181]

Conventional long-term studies to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of hydroxyurea have not been performed. However, hydroxyurea is presumed to be a transspecies carcinogen. Intraperitoneal administration of 125 to 250 mg/kg hydroxyurea (about 0.6-1.2 times the maximum recommended human oral daily dose on a mg/m2 basis) thrice weekly for 6 months in female rats increased the incidence of mammary tumors in rats surviving to 18 months compared to control. Hydroxyurea is mutagenic in vitro to bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and mammalian cells. Hydroxyurea is clastogenic in vitro (hamster cells, human lymphoblasts) and in vivo (SCE assay in rodents, mouse micronucleus assay). Hydroxyurea causes the transformation of rodent embryo cells to a tumorigenic phenotype.[L49181]

Safety in Adults: Evidence indicates that it is likely safe to use in oral and parenteral forms for up to two months when used appropriately. Some evidence indicates that it can be safely used orally for up to 9 months in some patients. It is also likely safe to use topically when used appropriately. Safety in Children: Melatonin appeared to be used safely in small numbers of children enrolled in short-term clinical trials. However, concerns regarding safety in children have arisen based on their developmental state. Compared to adults over 20 years of age, people under 20 produce high levels of melatonin. Melatonin levels are inversely related to gonadal development and it is thought that exogenous administration of melatonin may adversely affect gonadal development.

Symptoms of overdose in sulfonylureas, including glipizide, may be related to severe hypoglycemia and may include coma, seizure, or other neurological impairment. These are symptoms of severe hypoglycemia and require immediate treatment with glucagon or intravenous glucose and close monitoring for a minimum of 24 to 48 hours since hypoglycemia may recur after apparent clinical recovery.

DB01068,"Benzodiazepines like clonazepam commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. Overdose with clonazepam is generally not life-threatening if the drug is taken alone, but may lead to areflexia, apnea, hypotension, cardiorespiratory depression, and coma. Coma, if it does occur, usually lasts a few hours but it can become more protracted and cyclical, especially in elderly patients. Increased frequency of seizures may occur in patients at supratherapeutic plasma concentrations. Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious when compounded in patients with respiratory disease.

An increased risk of congenital malformations associated with the use of benzodiazepine drugs like clonazepam has been suggested in several studies [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796]. There may also be non-teratogenic risks associated with the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796]. There have been reports of neonatal flaccidity, respiratory and feeding difficulties, and hypothermia in children born to mothers who have been receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796]. In addition, children born to mothers receiving benzodiazepines late in pregnancy may be at some risk of experiencing withdrawal symptoms during the postnatal period [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796]. In general, it is best for patients who are of childbearing potential and also use benzodiazepines like clonazepam to discuss such matters with their health care professionals as careful consideration must be undertaken regarding the intersection of the risks of untreated seizure potential in the patient and any possible toxicity to the fetus [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796].

Although the active ingredient of clonazepam has been found to pass into the maternal milk in small amounts only, mothers receiving clonazepam should not breast-feed their infants [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796].

Since the possibility that adverse effects on the physical or mental development of the child could become apparent only after a number of years, the risk-benefit consideration of the long-term use of clonazepam in pediatric patients younger than five years of age is important [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796].

The pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines like clonazepam appear to be greater in elderly patients than in younger patients even at similar plasma benzodiazepine concentrations, possibly because of age-related changes in drug-receptor interactions, post-receptor mechanisms, and organ function [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796]. In general elderly patients should be started on the lowest possible dose of clonazepam and observed closely [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796]. There is an increased risk for falls and fractures among elderly and debilitated benzodiazepine users [FDA Label] [F3763, F3796].

Moreover, with higher doses, and particularly in children, symptoms of CNS excitation including hallucinations and convulsions may appear; with massive doses, coma or cardiovascular collapse may follow [F3394].

Although diphenhydramine has been in widespread use for many years without ill consequence, it is known to cross the placenta and has been detected in breast milk [F3394]. This medication should therefore only be used when the potential benefit of treatment to the mother exceeds any possible hazards to the developing fetus or suckling infant [F3394].

Pharmacokinetic studies indicate no major differences in the distribution or elimination of diphenhydramine compared to younger adults [F3394].

In 28 healthy subjects exposed to 90 to 180 mg per day of tegaserod (which is 7.5 to 15 times the recommended daily dosage) for several days, adverse reactions were diarrhea (100%), headache (57%), abdominal pain (18%), flatulence (18%), nausea (7%), and vomiting (7%) [F4223].

Although available data from case reports with tegaserod use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes, animal studies involving maternal dietary administration of tegaserod with doses 45 to 71 times the recommended dose demonstrated decreased body weight, delays in developmental landmarks, and decreased survival in rat pups [F4223]. Caution and careful consideration of risks versus benefits are recommended before administering tegaserod to a pregnant woman.

Despite there being little if any data available regarding the presence of tegaserod in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production, tegaserod and its metabolites are present in rat milk and the milk to plasma concentration ratio is very high in rats [F4223]. Subsequently, because of the potential for serious reactions in the breastfed infant, including tumorigenicity, breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with tegaserod [F4223].

The safety and effectiveness of tegaserod in pediatric patients has not yet been established [F4223].

Tegaserod is not indicated in patients that are aged 65 years or older [F4223].

Tegaserod was not carcinogenic in rats given oral dietary doses up to 180 mg/kg/day (approximately 93 to 111 times the recommended dose based on AUC) for 110 to 124 weeks [F4223]. In mice, dietary administration of tegaserod for 104 weeks produced mucosal hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the small intestine at 600 mg/kg/day (approximately 83 to 110 times the recommended dose based on AUC) [F4223]. There was no evidence of carcinogenicity at lower doses (3 to 35 times the recommended dose based on AUC) [F4223]. Tegaserod was not genotoxic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung fibroblast (CHL/V79) cell chromosomal aberration and forward mutation test, the in vitro rat hepatocyte unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) test or the in vivo mouse micronucleus test [F4223]. The results of the Ames test for mutagenicity were equivocal. Tegaserod at oral (dietary) doses up to 240 mg/kg/day (approximately 57 times the recommended dose based on AUC) in male rats and 150 mg/kg/day (approximately 42 times the recommended dose based on AUC) in female rats was found to have no effect on fertility and reproductive performance [F4223].

Inhibition of the hERG (human Ether-a-go-go-Related Gene) channel was evident only in the micromolar concentration range with an IC50 of 13 micromolar (approximately 1300 times the Cmax in humans at the recommended dose) [F4223]. In in vitro studies, tegaserod had no effects on impulse conduction in isolated guinea pig papillary muscle at up to 100 times the Cmax in humans, Langendorff-perfused isolated rabbit heart (QT interval) at up to 1000 times the Cmax in humans, or human atrial myocytes at multiples up to 10 times the Cmax in humans [F4223]. The major metabolite, M29, had no effect on QT in the Langendorff-perfused isolated rabbit heart at multiples up to 323 times the Cmax in humans [F4223].

In anesthetized and conscious dogs, tegaserod at doses up to 92 to 134 times the recommended dose based on Cmax did not alter heart rate, QRS interval duration, QTc or other ECG parameters [F4223]. In chronic toxicology studies in rats and dogs, there were no treatment-related changes in cardiac morphology after tegaserod administration at doses up to 660 times the recommended dose based on AUC [F4223].

Although tegaserod is expected to bind to 5-HT2B receptors in humans at the recommended dose, there does not appear to be any potential for heart valve injury based on functional evidence of 5-HT2B receptor antagonism [F4223].

Studies with isolated coronary and mesenteric blood vessels from non-human primates and humans showed no vasoconstrictor effect at concentrations approximately 100 times the human Cmax [F4223]. Tegaserod exhibited antagonism of 5-HT-mediated vasoconstriction via 5-HT1B receptors [F4223]. In rat thoracic aortic rings that were pre-constricted with phenylephrine or norepinephrine, tegaserod produced vasorelaxation, with IC50 values 6 and 64 times the Cmax plasma concentrations in humans, respectively [F4223]. No effects were observed in the basal tone of aortic rings at concentrations up to 1000 times the human Cmax [F4223].

In studies with an anesthetized rat model for measuring macro- and micro-circulation of the colon, intraduodenal dosing with tegaserod (approximately 7 times the recommended dose based on Cmax) produced no clinically relevant effect on blood pressure, heart rate, or vascular conductance [F4223].","Tegaserod is a serotonin-4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist indicated for the treatment of adult women less than 65 years of age with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) [F4223, F4229]. The safety and effectiveness of tegaserod in men with IBS-C have not been established [F4223, F4229]."

Capecitabine was not mutagenic in vitro to bacteria (Ames test) or mammalian cells (Chinese hamster V79/HPRT gene mutation assay). Capecitabine was clastogenic in vitro to human peripheral blood lymphocytes but not clastogenic in vivo to mouse bone marrow (micronucleus test). Fluorouracil causes mutations in bacteria and yeast. Fluorouracil also causes chromosomal abnormalities in the mouse micronucleus test in vivo.[L44657]

In studies of fertility and general reproductive performance in female mice, oral capecitabine doses of 760 mg/kg/day (about 2,300 mg/m2/day) disturbed estrus and consequently caused a decrease in fertility. In mice that became pregnant, no fetuses survived this dose. The disturbance in estrus was reversible. In males, this dose caused degenerative changes in the testes, including decreases in the number of spermatocytes and spermatids. In separate pharmacokinetic studies, this dose in mice produced 5’-DFUR AUC values about 0.7 times the corresponding values in patients administered the recommended daily dose.[L44657]

Based on findings in animal reproduction studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], XELODA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Available human data on XELODA use in pregnant women is not sufficient to inform the drug-associated risk.

DB01194,"Developmental toxicity studies with brinzolamide in rabbits at oral doses of 1, 3, and 6 mg/kg/day (20, 60, and 120 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) produced maternal toxicity at 6 mg/kg/day and a significant increase in the number of fetal variations, such as accessory skull bones, which was only slightly higher than the historical value at 1 and 6 mg/kg. In rats, statistically, decreased body weights of fetuses from dams receiving oral doses of 18 mg/kg/day (180 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose) during gestation were proportional to the reduced maternal weight gain, with no statistically significant effects on organ or tissue development. Increases in unossified sternebrae, reduced ossification of the skull, and unossified hyoid that occurred at 6 and 18 mg/kg were not statistically significant. No treatment-related malformations were seen. Following oral administration of 14C-brinzolamide 14Cbrinzolamide to pregnant rats, radioactivity was found to cross the placenta and was present in the fetal tissues and blood.[L46377]

Developmental toxicity studies performed in rats with oral doses of 0.66 mg brimonidine base/kg revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus. Dosing at this level resulted in a plasma drug concentration approximately 100 times higher than that seen in humans at the recommended human ophthalmic dose. In animal studies, brimonidine crossed the placenta and entered into fetal circulation to a limited extent.[L46377]

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Brinzolamide should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.[L46377] 

Brinzolamide caused urinary bladder tumors in female mice at oral doses of 10 mg/kg/day and in male rats at oral doses of 8 mg/kg/day in 2-year studies. Brinzolamide was not carcinogenic in male mice or female rats dosed orally for up to 2 years. The carcinogenicity appears secondary to kidney and urinary bladder toxicity. These levels of exposure cannot be achieved with topical ophthalmic dosing in humans.[L46377] 

The following tests for the mutagenic potential of brinzolamide were negative: (1) in vivo mouse micronucleus assay; (2) in vivo sister chromatid exchange assay; and (3) Ames E. coli test. The in vitro mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay was negative in the absence of activation, but positive in the presence of microsomal activation. In this assay, there was no consistent dose-response relationship to the increased mutation frequency and cytotoxicity likely contributed to the high mutation frequency. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, as a class, are not mutagenic and the weight of evidence supports that brinzolamide is consistent with the class.

Some signs and symptoms of a quetiapine overdose include sedation, drowsiness, tachycardia, and hypotension. Clinical trials demonstrate that overdoses of up to 30 grams of quetiapine did not result in death. A lethal outcome was reported in a clinical trial after an overdose of 13.6 grams of quetiapine.  In the case of an acute overdose, ensure to maintain an airway and provide adequate ventilation and oxygenation. Gastric lavage following intubation (if necessary) along with activated charcoal and a laxative may be considered. The possibility of obtundation, seizure or dystonic reaction of the head and neck following overdose may create a risk of aspiration with induced emesis. Cardiac monitoring should also take place.[L8546]

**A note on QT-interval prolongation in an overdose**

Postmarketing reports reveal increases in the cardiac QT interval in cases of quetiapine overdose, concomitant illness, and in those taking drugs that increase QT interval or affect electrolyte levels.[L8546]  Note that disopyramide, procainamide, and quinidine may exert additive QT-prolonging effects when administered in patients who have overdosed with quetiapine, and should be avoided.[A185834,A185837,L8546]","Quetiapine is used in the symptomatic treatment of schizophrenia.  In addition, it may be used for the management of acute manic or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder, as a monotherapy or combined with other drugs. It may be used to manage depressive episodes in bipolar disorder. In addition to the above indications, quetiapine is used in combination with antidepressant drugs for the treatment of major depression.[L8546]

Some symptoms of an overdose with metoclopramide include drowsiness, disorientation, and extrapyramidal reactions. Drugs that manage Parkinson's disease or anticholinergic drugs or antihistamines with anticholinergic properties [A185174] should be employed to treat extrapyramidal symptoms. Normally, these symptoms subside within 24 hours.[L8414] Unintentional overdose in infants receiving the oral solution of metoclopramide resulted in seizures, extrapyramidal symptoms, in addition to a lethargic state.

In addition, methemoglobinemia has been found to occur in premature and full-term neonates after a metoclopramide overdose. Intravenous methylene blue may treat metoclopramide-associated methemoglobinemia. It is important to note that methylene blue administration may lead to hemolytic anemia in patients who suffer from G6PD deficiency, which can result in fatality. Dialysis has not been shown to be effective in sufficiently eliminating metoclopramide in an overdose situation due to low plasma distribution of this drug.[L8414]","Metoclopramide in the oral tablet form is used for symptomatic treatment of both acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis, in addition to the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in patients who have failed to respond to traditional therapy.[L8414] A nasal spray formulation is also indicated to treat adults with acute, recurrent diabetic gastroparesis.[L14381]

In the intravenous injection form, it is indicated for the above conditions as well as for the prevention of vomiting that may follow emetogenic chemotherapy or nausea and vomiting after surgery. Intravenous metoclopramide facilitates intubation of the small bowel and stimulates gastric emptying and barium flow in patients who require radiological examination of the stomach or small intestine.

DB01238,"Neonates exposed to antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY, during the third trimester of  pregnancy are at risk for extrapyramidal and/or withdrawal symptoms following delivery. Overall available data from published epidemiologic studies of pregnant women exposed to aripiprazole have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, or major depressive disorder, and with exposure to antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, during pregnancy.[L45859] 

In animal reproduction studies, oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during organogenesis in rats and/or rabbits at doses 10 and 19 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area, produced fetal death, decreased fetal weight, undescended testicles, delayed skeletal ossification, skeletal abnormalities, and diaphragmatic hernia. Oral and intravenous aripiprazole administration during the pre- and post-natal period in rats at doses 10 times the MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area, produced prolonged gestation, stillbirths, decreased pup weight, and decreased pup survival.[L45859]  

ABILIFY has not been systematically studied in humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance, or physical dependence. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for a history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of ABILIFY misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, increases in dose, drug-seeking behavior).[L45859]

In physical dependence studies in monkeys, withdrawal symptoms were observed upon abrupt cessation of dosing. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted, and/or abused once marketed.[L45859] 

In clinical trials and in postmarketing experience, adverse reactions of deliberate or accidental overdosage with oral ABILIFY have been reported worldwide. These include overdoses with oral ABILIFY alone and in combination with other substances. No fatality was reported with ABILIFY alone. The largest known dose with a known outcome involved acute ingestion of 1,260 mg of oral ABILIFY (42 times the maximum recommended daily dose) by a patient who fully recovered. Deliberate or accidental overdosage was also reported in children (age 12 years and younger) involving oral ABILIFY ingestions up to 195 mg with no fatalities.[L45859]  

Common adverse reactions (reported in at least 5% of all overdose cases) reported with oral ABILIFY overdosage (alone or in combination with other substances) include vomiting, somnolence, and tremor. Other clinically important signs and symptoms observed in one or more patients with ABILIFY overdoses (alone or with other substances) include acidosis, aggression, aspartate aminotransferase increased, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, coma, confusional state, convulsion, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, depressed level of consciousness, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypotension, lethargy, loss of consciousness, QRS complex prolonged, QT prolonged, pneumonia aspiration, respiratory arrest, status epilepticus, and tachycardia.[L45859] 

No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with ABILIFY. An electrocardiogram should be obtained in case of overdosage and if QT interval prolongation is present, cardiac monitoring should be instituted. Otherwise, management of overdose should concentrate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and management of symptoms. Close medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recovers.[L45859]  
_Charcoal_: In the event of an overdose of ABILIFY, an early charcoal administration may be useful in partially preventing the absorption of aripiprazole. Administration of 50 g of activated charcoal, one hour after a single 15 mg oral dose of ABILIFY, decreased the mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of aripiprazole by 50%.[L45859] 
_Hemodialysis_: Although there is no information on the effect of hemodialysis in treating an overdose with ABILIFY, hemodialysis is unlikely to be useful in overdose management since aripiprazole is highly bound to plasma proteins.[L45859]  

Lifetime carcinogenicity studies were conducted in ICR mice, F344 rats, and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Aripiprazole was administered for 2 years in the diet at doses of 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/day to ICR mice and 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg/day to F344 rats (0.2, 0.5, 2 and 5 times and 0.3, 1 and 3 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area, respectively). In addition, SD rats were dosed orally for 2 years at 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day, which are 3, 6, 13 and 19 times the MRHD based on mg/m2 body surface area. Aripiprazole did not induce tumors in male mice or male rats. In female mice, the incidences of pituitary gland adenomas and mammary gland adenocarcinomas and adenoacanthomas were increased at dietary doses of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day (0.5 to 5 times the MRHD). In female rats, the incidence of mammary gland fibroadenomas was increased at a dietary dose of 10 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD); and the incidences of adrenocortical carcinomas and combined adrenocortical adenomas/carcinomas were increased at an oral dose of 60 mg/kg/day (19 times the MRHD).[L45859] 

An increase in mammary, pituitary, and endocrine pancreas neoplasms has been found in rodents after chronic administration of other antipsychotic drugs and is considered to be mediated by prolonged dopamine D2-receptor antagonism and hyperprolactinemia. Serum prolactin was not measured in the aripiprazole carcinogenicity studies. However, increases in serum prolactin levels were observed in female mice in a 13 week dietary study at the doses associated with mammary gland and pituitary tumors. Serum prolactin was not increased in female rats in 4 week and 13 week dietary studies at the dose associated with mammary gland tumors. The relevance for human risk of the findings of prolactin-mediated endocrine tumors in rodents is unclear.[L45859]

The mutagenic potential of aripiprazole was tested in the in vitro bacterial reverse-mutation assay, the in vitro bacterial DNA repair assay, the in vitro forward gene mutation assay in mouse lymphoma cells, the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells, the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice, and the unscheduled DNA synthesis assay in rats. Aripiprazole and a metabolite (2,3-DCPP) were clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in CHL cells with and without metabolic activation. The metabolite, 2,3-DCPP, increased numerical aberrations in the in vitro assay in CHL cells in the absence of metabolic activation. A positive response was obtained in the in vivo micronucleus assay in mice; however, the response was due to a mechanism not considered relevant to humans.[L45859] 

Female rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation Day 7 at doses of 2, 6, and 20 mg/kg/day, which are 0.6, 2, and 6 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area. Estrus cycle irregularities and increased corpora lutea were seen at all doses, but no impairment of fertility was seen. Increased pre-implantation loss was seen at 2 and 6 times the MRHD, and decreased fetal weight was seen at 6 times the MRHD.[L45859] 

Male rats were treated orally with aripiprazole from 9 weeks prior to mating through mating at doses of 20, 40, and 60 mg/kg/day, which are 6, 13, and 19 times the MRHD of 30 mg/day based on mg/m2 body surface area. Disturbances in spermatogenesis were seen at 19 times the MRHD and prostate atrophy was seen at 13 and 19 times the MRHD without impairment of fertility.[L45859]

Overdose information

Administering excess phenazopyridine above the daily recommended dose in those with healthy or impaired kidney function may increase the drug concentration and predispose the patient to toxicity. When a large overdose occurs, methemoglobinemia results.[A182141,A182144]  To treat this condition, Methylene blue at 1 to 2 mg/kg/dose should be administered intravenously as a 1% solution as deemed necessary. Its administration is likely to cause a rapid reduction of the methemoglobinemia state and relieve the associated cyanosis. Hemolytic anemia is also a risk when an overdose occurs, and “bite cells” may be observed in a blood smear after an overdose with phenazopyridine. Red blood cell G6PD deficiency may increase the risk of hemolysis, and even normal doses can lead to methemoglobinemia in patients with this condition. Nephrotoxicity, renal failure, and hepatic impairment may also occur in a case of overdose with this drug. Administer symptomatic and supportive treatment as necessary.[A182138,A182147,L7844]","Phenazopyridine hydrochloride is indicated to relieve uncomfortable symptoms that occur as a consequence of mucosal irritation of the lower urinary tract in adults.

The following indications have shown promise and are backed up by some scientific evidence: schizophrenia (DHEA may be more effective in women than men); improving the appearance of older people’s skin (taking DHEA by mouth seems to increase skin thickness and moisture, and decrease facial “age spots” in elderly men and women); improving ability to achieve an erection in men with sexual dysfunction. Additionally, DHEA has shown promise in improving symptoms of lupus (SLE). Taking DHEA by mouth along with conventional treatment may help reduce the number of times symptoms flare up and may allow a reduction in the dose of prescription drugs needed. DHEA may also help SLE symptoms such as muscle ache and mouth ulcers. DHEA also seems to strengthen bones in SLE patients being treated with high-dose steroids (corticosteroids).
DHEA also shows promise in the treatment of osteoporosis. Taking DHEA by mouth daily seems to improve bone mineral density (BMD) in older women and men with osteoporosis or osteopenia (pre-osteoporosis). DHEA may also increase BMD in young women with the eating disorder called anorexia nervosa. DHEA is often prescribed in India for the induction of ovulation to improve chances of pregnancy."

","There is currently no clinically approved and/or marketed medicine that relies upon pidolic acid as an active ingredient for any formal therapeutic indication.

Although pidolic acid may be sold in a variety of non-prescription, over-the-counter dietary supplement products for cognitive or memory enhancement, there are many studies that suggest that such products or such supplementation do not elicit any kind of cognitive benefit to users [A32981, A32982]. In fact, the general suggestion for any such pidolic acid product is to exercise caution in their recommendation as much more research is necessary [A32981].

Pidolic acid and sodium pidolic acid are, however, used to some extent in skin and hair conditioning agents owing to their humectant characteristics [F53]."

Medical reports of acute exposures of workers to propionic acid show mild to moderate skin burns, mild eye redness, and one case of a mild cough and asthmatic response [L2728].","Propanoic acid and various direct sodium or calcium salt formulations of the acid are currently most commonly approved and indicated by organizations like the FDA and EMA for use as an antibacterial food additive preservative in animal feed and food for human consumption [L2715, L2716].

Similarly, although the use of propanoic acid or any of its direct sodium or calcium salt formulations as excipient ingredients in pharmaceuticals is not necessarily a major role for the compound today, sodium propionate was used in some vaginal cream preparations indicated for cervicitis, cervical tears, and/or postcauterization, postcryosurgery, and postconization of the cervix [T193]. In such products, the sodium propionate was primarily used to elicit a preservative, bacteriostatic [L2710, F50] effect while other active ingredients combined in the formulation like urea, benzalkonium chloride, inositol, and methionine and cystine amino acids facilitated debridement, enhanced medication spread, epithelialization promotion, and wound healing, respectively [L2710, A32973].

Nevertheless, a great variety of propionic acid derivatives exist as separate pharmaceuticals, each with their own unique therapeutic categories, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics."

DB04896,"There is limited clinical experience with milnacipran overdose in humans. In clinical trials, cases of acute ingestions up to 1000 mg daily were reported with none being fatal [F3925]. In postmarketing experience, fatal outcomes have been reported for acute overdoses primarily involving multiple drugs but also with milnacipran only [F3925]. The most common signs and symptoms of overdose included increased blood pressure, cardio-respiratory arrest, changes in the level of consciousness (ranging from somnolence to coma), confusional state, dizziness, and increased hepatic enzymes [F3919, F3922, F3925].

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women [F3919, F3922, F3925]. In fact, milnacipram should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus [F3919, F3922, F3925].

Neonates exposed to SSRIs or SNRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying [F3919, F3922, F3925]. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SNRI class drugs like milnacipran or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome [F3919, F3922, F3925]. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [F3919, F3922, F3925].

The effect of milnacipran on labor and delivery in humans is unknown [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Milnacipran should be used during labor and delivery only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks [F3919, F3922, F3925].

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing mothers [F3919, F3922, F3925]. It is not known if milnacipran is excreted in human milk [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Studies have shown that levomilnacipran is excreted into the milk of lactating rats [F3919, F3922, F3925]. Subsequently, possible excretion into human milk possesses the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants [F3919, F3922, F3925]. As a consequence, breastfeeding by women treated with levomilnacipran should be considered only if the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks to the child [F3919, F3922, F3925].

Milnacipran is not indicated for use in children under 18 years of age due to concerns over the potential for agitation-type emotional and behavioral changes, as well as suicidal ideation and/or behavior [F3919, F3922, F3925].

SNRIs like milnacipran have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event [F3919, F3922, F3925].

Levomilnacipran was not mutagenic when evaluated in vitro in a bacterial mutagenicity study (Ames test) and not genotoxic in a mouse lymphoma study [F3919, F3922, F3925]. It was not clastogenic in an in vivo micronucleus assay in rats [F3919, F3922, F3925].

The potential effects of levomilnacipran on gonadal function, mating behavior, reproductive performance and early pregnancy were evaluated in rats at oral doses of 0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day [F3919, F3922, F3925]. The NOAEL was 100 mg/kg/day based on reductions in body weight gain and food consumption [F3919, F3922, F3925]. There were no levomilnacipran effects on male and female fertility parameters [F3919, F3922, F3925].

In the rat and rabbit embryo/fetal development studies, decreases in maternal body weight gain and food consumption were noted [F3919, F3922, F3925]. In the fetuses, increases in the incidence of ossification anomalies were noted but were of no toxicological significance [F3919, F3922, F3925]. In both species, the NOAEL was determined to be 100 mg/kg/day, a dose which represents a rat or rabbit animal-to-human exposure margin of 9-fold and 4-fold, respectively relative to the human exposure from 120 mg/day of levomilnacipran [F3919, F3922, F3925].    
 
Material safety data for milnacipran has documented the LD50 oral value in the rat model as being 213 mg/kg [MSDS].","Milnacipran is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) indicated for the management of fibromyalgia in patients that are 18 years old or above [F3925]. 

While milnacipran may be used for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), it is only recommended in adult patients who are 18 years old or above [F3922] due to an increased risk for suicidal ideation, thinking, and behavior in children, adolescents, and young adults taking antidepressants for major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Some regional prescribing information notes that the use of the medication is specifically for the short-term symptomatic relief of MDD [F3919]. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the regulatory approval of and/or indications listed here for milnacipran may or may not exist and/or vary greatly between regions and nations [F3928, F3934]."

In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of palovarotene to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in multiple fetal malformations typical of retinoids (e.g., cleft palate, malformed skull bone, shortening of the long bones) at doses ≥0.25 mg/kg/day (less than the clinical exposure). There are no available human data on palovarotene use in pregnant women. If pregnancy occurs during treatment with palovarotene, discontinue treatment immediately and refer the patient to an obstetrician/gynecologist or other specialist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.[L47830]

No clinical experience with an overdose of palovarotene has been reported. Palovarotene is a derivative of vitamin A. In case of accidental overdose, signs of hypervitaminosis A could appear, including severe headache, nausea or vomiting, drowsiness, irritability, and pruritus. Any overdose should be treated with supportive care according to the signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient.  If an overdose is suspected, patients should be treated with supportive care as clinically indicated.[L47830]

Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of palovarotene have not been conducted. Palovarotene and its metabolites were negative in the vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and an in vitro micronucleus assay in primary human lymphocyte. Palovarotene did not have any clastogenic effect in the in vivo mouse micronucleus study.[L47830]

Palovarotene effects on fertility and reproductive function were assessed in male and female rats. In a female rat fertility study, palovarotene was orally administered to females for 14 days prior to mating with drug naïve males and up to GD 7 at the dose levels of 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day. Palovarotene caused prolonged periods of diestrous and reduced ovulation rate, resulting in lower numbers of implantation sites and live embryos at 3 mg/kg/day, a dose associated with maternal toxicity.[L47830]

In a male rat fertility study, palovarotene was orally administered prior to mating, during mating, and up to scheduled euthanasia (approximately 11 weeks in total) at 0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg/day. Palovarotene did not cause adverse effects on mating, fertility indices, conception rate, reproductive organ weights, or sperm parameters up to 1 mg/kg/day (less than the clinical exposure). Males did not tolerate 3 mg/kg/day, as it produced severe systemic toxicity including deaths, adverse skin and hair coat clinical signs, and substantially reduced body weight.[L47830]","Palovarotene is indicated in Canada to reduce the formation of heterotopic ossification in adults and children (≥8 years old for females and ≥10 years old for males) with Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) by Health Canada and FDA.[L39990,L47830]"

Available data from case reports on lumateperone use in pregnant women are insufficient to establish any drug associated risks for birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. There are risks to the mother associated with untreated schizophrenia and with exposure to antipsychotics, including lumateperone, during pregnancy. In animal reproduction studies, no malformations were observed with oral administration of lumateperone to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 9.7 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 42 mg/day on a mg/m2 basis. When pregnant rats were administered lumateperone during the period of organogenesis through lactation, the number of perinatal deaths of pups was increased at 4.9 times the MRHD, with no adverse effects on pups at 2.4 times the MRHD.[L47171]

It is caused by the production of autoantibodies against ADAMTS-13 which is the protein in charge of cleaving the von-Wilebrand factor. The lack of this process produces the generation of ultra large von Wilebrand multimers that bind to platelets and form microthrombi and causing thromboembolic complications.[A174649]

As pixantrone is a blue compound patients may experience a blue discoloration of the skin and urine. [2] ","Currently in Phase III investigation for treatment of relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients who have failed two prior lines of therapy. Presently, no standard therapy exists for patients with relapsed or refractory NHL. [2] After first line therapy has been initiated, most patients have received their lifetime limit of doxorubicin and further use of anthracyclines may potentially lead to anthracycline-induced congestive heart failure (CHF). Pixantrone is an attractive alternative as a second line agent, due to its lack of cardiac toxicity. [2] 

The phase III trial, PIX-R, is ongoing and will compare pixantrone multidrug therapy with an equivalent regimen in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (the most common type of NHL).

Previous study results have also suggested the possibility that pixantrone may be safe and effective in doxorubicin naive patients. In myocardial strips which are doxorubicin naive, pixantrone is taken up to a higher degree than in myocardial strips which are doxorubicin exposed, and once absorbed exhibits redox inactivity.

DB06196,"Available data from published literature and the pharmacovigilance database with icatibant use in pregnant women have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, icatibant, administered by the subcutaneous route during the period of organogenesis, did not cause structural abnormalities in rats or rabbits; however, premature birth and abortion were observed in rabbits at doses approximately 0.025 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) and higher. Decreased embryofetal survival was observed in rabbits at a subcutaneous dose that was 13 times the MRHD. In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, delayed parturition was observed at subcutaneous doses 0.5 times the MRHD and higher, which resulted in deaths of dams at doses 2 times the MRHD and higher. Fetal death and early pup deaths were observed with doses 2 times the MRHD.[L49756]

Two-year studies were conducted in CD1 mice and Wistar rats to assess the carcinogenic potential of icatibant. No evidence of tumorigenicity was observed in mice and rats at icatibant subcutaneous doses up to 15 mg/kg/day (twice per week) and 6 mg/kg/day (daily), respectively (approximately 10-fold and 6-fold greater than the MRHD on an AUC basis, respectively).[L49756]

Icatibant tested negative for genotoxicity in the in vitro Ames bacterial reverse mutation test, in vitro Chinese hamster bone marrow chromosome aberration assay, and in vivo mouse micronucleus test.[L49756]

Daily subcutaneous administration of icatibant to rats and dogs caused ovarian, uterine, and testicular atrophy/degeneration and adverse effects on the mammary and prostate glands. In rats, testicular atrophy, reduced prostate gland secretion, decreased testosterone levels and degenerate corpora lutea occurred at doses greater than or equal to 3 mg/kg (approximately 5-fold greater than the MRHD in males and 2-fold greater than the MRHD in females on an AUC basis) and a decrease in developing ovarian follicles, mammary gland masculinization, and uterine atrophy occurred at doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg (approximately 6-fold greater than MRHD in females on an AUC basis). In dogs, reduced sperm counts and uterine atrophy occurred at doses greater than or equal to 1 mg/kg (approximately 2-fold greater than the MRHD on an AUC basis). Atrophy of the testes and prostate with decreased testosterone levels, decreased ovary size and decreased number of developing follicles occurred at a dose of 10 mg/kg (approximately 30-fold greater than the MRHD in males and 15-fold greater than at the MRHD in females on an AUC basis).[L49756]

In contrast to the effects of daily icatibant administration, toxicity to the ovary, uterus, testis, mammary gland, and prostate did not occur in dogs treated twice a week for 9 months. AUC exposures from a dose of 3 mg/kg in these dogs were 5- and 3-fold the MRHD exposures in men and women, respectively. Sperm counts and testosterone remained unaffected over the course of the study in male dogs dosed twice a week.[L49756]

Reproduction studies in male mice and rats with daily administration of icatibant found no effects on fertility or reproductive performance with intravenous doses up to 81 mg/kg (approximately 5-fold greater than the MRHD on a mg/m2 basis) or subcutaneous doses up to 10 mg/kg (approximately 11-fold greater than the MRHD on an AUC basis), respectively.[L49756] 

In a clinical study evaluating a 90 mg dose (30 mg in each of 3 subcutaneous sites), the adverse event profile was similar to that seen with 30 mg administered in a single subcutaneous site.[L49756]

Doripenem's FDA label includes a warning against use in ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, as a clinical trial for that indication resulted in increased mortality with doripenem (23% vs. 16.7% recieving imipenem) as well as lower clinical response rates. 

Seizures have been reported with doripenem treatment; patients at greater risk of developing seizures we found to have pre-existing central nervous system (CNS) conditions, compromised renal function, or patients receiving higher doses than 500 mg every 8 hours. Doripenem also reduces plasma levels of valproic acid when administered concomitantly; therefore patients with pre-existing seizure disorders on valproic acid are at even higher risk of breakthrough seizures if receiving both drugs at the same time. 

Doripenem is considered pregnancy category B as it was not found to be teratogenic or produce effects on ossification, developmental delays, or fetal weight in rat and rabbit studies. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known whether doripenem is excreted into breast milk, therefore caution should be exercised with doripenem administration to nursing women.

Feraheme (ferumoxytol) may cause serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and/or anaphylactoid reactions. Serious hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 0.2% (3/1,726) of subjects administered Feraheme. Some other reactions potentially associated with hypersensitivity (e.g., pruritus, rash, urticaria or wheezing) were reported in 3.7% (63/1,726) of these subjects. It is necessary to monitor patients for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity for at least 30 minutes following Feraheme injection and limit administration of the drug only to when personnel and therapies are readily available for the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions [L54496].  

Ferumoxytol was not tested for carcinogenic effects. In general genotoxicity tests, ferumoxytol showed no evidence of mutagenic activity in an in vitro Ames test or clastogenic activity in either an in vitro chromosomal aberration assay or an in vivo micronucleus assay. No adverse effects on fertility were observed in animal studies. Ferumoxytol had no effect on male or female fertility or general reproductive function in rats [L54496].

Myelosuppression, with the primary clinical manifestation of neutropenia and leucopenia, is the dose-limiting toxicity of this drug. In addition to this, mucositis, nausea, vomiting, and alopecia are frequent. Hepatopathy, observed with elevated bilirubin concentrations, occurs less frequently. Cardiotoxicity is a major adverse effect of the anthracycline antibiotics and may be acute or chronic; in the acute setting, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities may be observed, demonstrating ST-T elevations and arrhythmias, however, chronic cardiotoxicity poses a serious risk that may be lethal due to the slow development of irreversible, cardiomyopathy. The occurrence of toxicity shows a significant interindividual variation, and for this reason, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anthracyclines have been heavily investigated in order to identify models that may be used in the clinical setting to prevent the development of serious toxicity, mainly leucopenia, and maximize tumor exposure [A32142]. Interestingly, a recent study was done to further examine genetic predisposition neutropenia/amrubicin toxicity. It was determined that C3435T polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene might be able to predict severe amrubicin-induced neutropenia [A32147].

Secondary alcohol metabolites of earlier generation anthracyclines have been shown to lead to cardiac toxicity which is a major toxicity of conventional anthracyclines and thus limits the amount that can be delivered safely to patients. 
Clinical manifestations of toxicity observed on the acute and repeated administration of amrubicin in rats and dogs were dose-related and reversible including fecal changes (mucoid or bloody feces/diarrhea), body weight decreases, decreased food consumption, decreased activity, and alopecia. Similar findings were observed at doses of doxorubicin approximately one half those of amrubicin [L1710].",Investigated for use/treatment in lung cancer [A4138].

DB06700,"Published epidemiological studies of pregnant women exposed to the parent compound venlafaxine have not reported a clear association with major birth defects or miscarriage. Methodological limitations of these observational studies include possible exposure and outcome misclassification, lack of adequate controls, adjustment for confounders, and confirmatory studies; therefore, these studies cannot establish or exclude any drug-associated risk during pregnancy.[L47936] 

Retrospective cohort studies based on claims data have shown an association between venlafaxine use and preeclampsia, compared to depressed women who did not take an antidepressant during pregnancy. One study that assessed venlafaxine exposure in the second trimester or first half of the third trimester and preeclampsia showed an increased risk compared to unexposed depressed women (adjusted (adj) RR 1.57, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.91). Preeclampsia was observed at venlafaxine doses equal to or greater than 75 mg/day and a duration of treatment >30 days. Another study that assessed venlafaxine exposure in gestational weeks 10 to 20 and preeclampsia showed an increased risk at doses equal to or greater than 150 mg/day. Available data are limited by possible outcome misclassification and possible confounding due to depression severity and other confounders.[L47936] 

Retrospective cohort studies based on claims data have suggested an association between venlafaxine use near the time of delivery or through delivery and postpartum hemorrhage. One study showed an increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage when venlafaxine exposure occurred through delivery, compared to unexposed depressed women (adj RR 2.24, 95% CI 1.69 to 2.97). There was no increased risk in women who were exposed to venlafaxine earlier in pregnancy. Limitations of this study include possible confounding due to depression severity and other confounders. Another study showed an increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage when SNRI exposure occurred for at least 15 days in the last month of pregnancy or through delivery, compared to unexposed women (adj RR 1.64 to 1.76). The results of this study may be confounded by the effects of depression. Neonates exposed to SNRIs or SSRIs, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome.[L47936]

Antidepressants, such as desvenlafaxine, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patient.[L47936]

Of the 4,158 patients in pre-marketing clinical studies with desvenlafaxine, 6% were 65 years of age or older. No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed between these patients and younger patients; however, in the short-term placebo-controlled studies, there was a higher incidence of systolic orthostatic hypotension in patients ≥65 years of age compared to patients <65 years of age treated with desvenlafaxine. For elderly patients, possible reduced renal clearance of desvenlafaxine should be considered when determining dose. SSRIs and SNRIs, including desvenlafaxine, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse event.[L47936]

There is limited clinical trial experience with desvenlafaxine succinate overdosage in humans. However, desvenlafaxine is the major active metabolite of venlafaxine. Overdose experience reported with venlafaxine (the parent drug of desvenlafaxine) is presented below; the identical information can be found in the Overdosage section of the venlafaxine package insert. In 
post-marketing experience, overdose with venlafaxine (the parent drug of desvenlafaxine) has occurred predominantly in combination with alcohol and/or other drugs. The most commonly reported events in overdosage include tachycardia, changes in level of consciousness (ranging from somnolence to coma), mydriasis, seizures, and vomiting. Electrocardiogram changes (e.g., prolongation of QT interval, bundle branch block, QRS prolongation), sinus and ventricular tachycardia, bradycardia, hypotension, rhabdomyolysis, vertigo, liver necrosis, serotonin syndrome, and death have been reported. Published retrospective studies report that venlafaxine overdosage may be associated with an increased risk of fatal outcomes compared to that observed with SSRI antidepressant products, but lower than that for tricyclic antidepressants. Epidemiological studies have shown that venlafaxine-treated patients have a higher pre-existing burden of suicide risk factors than SSRI-treated patients. The extent to which the finding of an increased risk of fatal outcomes can be attributed to the toxicity of venlafaxine in overdosage, as opposed to some characteristic(s) of venlafaxine-treated patients, is not clear.[L47936]

No specific antidotes for desvenlafaxine are known. In managing over dosage, consider the possibility of multiple drug involvement. In case of overdose, call Poison Control Center at 
1-800-222-1222 for latest recommendations.[L47936] 

Desvenlafaxine succinate administered by oral gavage to mice and rats for 2 years did not increase the incidence of tumors in either study. Mice received desvenlafaxine succinate at dosages up to 500/300 mg/kg/day (dosage lowered after 45 weeks of dosing). The AUC exposure at 300 mg/kg/day dose is estimated at 10 times the AUC exposure at an adult human dose of 100 mg per day. Rats received desvenlafaxine succinate at dosages up to 300 mg/kg/day (males) or 500 mg/kg/day (females). The AUC exposure at the highest dose is estimated at 11 (males) or 26 (females) times the AUC exposure at an adult human dose of 100 mg per day.[L47936]

Desvenlafaxine was not mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial mutation assay (Ames test) and was not clastogenic in an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in cultured CHO cells, an in 
vivo mouse micronucleus assay, or an in vivo chromosome aberration assay in rats. Additionally, desvenlafaxine was not genotoxic in the in vitro CHO mammalian cell forward mutation assay and was negative in the in vitro BALB/c-3T3 mouse embryo cell transformation assay.[L47936]

There was no effect on fertility at 100 mg/kg/day, which is 3 (males) or 5 (females) times the AUC exposure at an adult human dose of 100 mg per day. These studies did not address reversibility of the effect on fertility. The relevance of these findings to humans is not known.[L47936]",Desvenlafaxine is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults.[L47936] It has also been used off-label to treat hot flashes in menopausal women.[A261166]

No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage of pralatrexate. If an overdose occurs, general supportive measures should be instituted as deemed necessary by the treating healthcare provider. Based on pralatrexate's mechanism of action, consider the prompt administration of [leucovorin].[L37674]

Carcinogenicity studies and fertility studies have not been performed with pralatrexate.[L37674]Based on findings from animal studies and its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)], pralatrexate can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are insufficient data on pralatrexate use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk. Pralatrexate was embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits when administered during organogenesis at doses about 1.2% (0.012 times) of
the clinical dose on an mg/m<sup>2</sup> basis. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus.[L37674]

Pralatrexate did not cause mutations in the Ames test or the Chinese hamster ovary cell chromosome aberration assay. Nevertheless, these tests do not reliably predict genotoxicity for this class of compounds. Pralatrexate did not cause mutations in the mouse micronucleus assay.[L37674]

A Medicaid cohort linkage study of 1152 statin-exposed pregnant women compared to 886,996 controls did not find a significant teratogenic effect from maternal use of statins in the first trimester of pregnancy, after adjusting for potential confounders – including maternal age, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and alcohol and tobacco use – using propensity score-based methods. The relative risk of congenital malformations between the group with statin use and the group with no statin use in the first trimester was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.37) after controlling for confounders, particularly pre-existing diabetes mellitus. There were also no statistically significant increases in any of the organ-specific malformations assessed after accounting for confounders. In the majority of pregnancies, statin treatment was initiated prior to pregnancy and was discontinued at some point in the first trimester when pregnancy was identified. Study limitations include reliance on physician coding to define the presence of a malformation, lack of control for certain confounders such as body mass index, use of prescription dispensing as verification for the use of a statin, and lack of information on non-live births.[L48616]

Aflibercept produced adverse embryofetal effects in rabbits, including external, visceral, and skeletal malformations. A fetal No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. At the lowest dose shown to produce adverse embryofetal effects, systemic exposure (based on AUC for free aflibercept) was approximately 0.9 -fold of the population pharmacokinetic estimated exposure in humans after an intravitreal dose of 8 mg.[L47915]

Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, and it is not known whether EYLEA HD can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Based on the anti-VEGF mechanism of action for aflibercept, treatment with aflibercept may pose a risk to human embryofetal development. Aflibercept should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.[L47915]

Overdosing with increased injection volume may increase intraocular pressure. Therefore, in case of overdosage, intraocular pressure should be monitored and if deemed necessary by the treating physician, adequate treatment should be initiated.[L47915]

No studies have been conducted on the mutagenic or carcinogenic potential of aflibercept. Effects on male and female fertility were assessed as part of a 6-month study in monkeys with intravenous administration of aflibercept at weekly doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg per kg. Absent or irregular menses associated with alterations in female reproductive hormone levels and changes in sperm morphology and motility were observed at all dose levels. In addition, females showed decreased ovarian and uterine weight accompanied by compromised luteal development and reduction of maturing follicles. These changes correlated with uterine and vaginal atrophy. All changes were reversible within 20 weeks after cessation of treatment. A No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was not identified. Intravenous administration of the lowest dose of aflibercept assessed in monkeys (3 mg per kg) resulted in systemic exposure (AUC) for free aflibercept that was 91 times higher than the population pharmacokinetic estimated systemic exposure in humans after an intravitreal dose of 8 mg.[L47915]

DB08930,"Data from an ongoing birth outcome surveillance study has identified an increased risk of neural tube defects when dolutegravir is administered at the time of conception. As defects related to the closure of the neural tube occur from conception through the first 6 weeks of gestation, embryos exposed to dolutegravir from the time of conception through the first 6 weeks of gestation are at potential risk.

Advise adolescents and adults of childbearing potential, including those actively trying to become pregnant, of the potential risk of neural tube defects with the use of TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD. Assess the risks and benefits of TIVICAY and TIVICAY PD and discuss with the patient to determine if an alternative treatment should be considered at the time of conception through the first trimester of pregnancy or if pregnancy is confirmed in the first trimester. A benefit-risk assessment should consider factors such as the feasibility of switching to another antiretroviral regimen, tolerability, ability to maintain viral suppression, and risk of HIV-1 transmission to the infant against the risk of neural tube defects associated with in-utero dolutegravir exposure during critical periods of fetal development [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

There are insufficient human data on the use of dolutegravir during pregnancy to definitively assess a drug-associated risk for birth defects and miscarriage. The background risk for major birth defects for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background rate for major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

In animal reproduction studies, no evidence of adverse developmental outcomes was observed with dolutegravir at systemic exposures (AUC) less than (rabbits) and approximately 27 times (rats) the exposure in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of TIVICAY (see Data). 

There is no known specific treatment for an overdose with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD. If an overdose occurs, the patient should be monitored, and standard supportive treatment applied as required. As dolutegravir is highly bound to plasma proteins, it is unlikely that it will be significantly removed by dialysis.

About 1 - 2 % of women undergoing ovarian stimulation develop a severe form of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Severe OHSS can be life-threatening. Complications may include: ascites, pulmonary edema, electrolyte disturbances (sodium, potassium, others), thrombosis in large vessels, usually in the lower extremities, renal failure, ovarian torsion, rupture of ovarian cysts. Some of these conditions can lead to hemorrhage, respiratory failure, spontaneous miscarriage or pregnancy termination due to complications, resulting in death [L2270].

The Million Women Study (MWS), which had a prospective observational design, studied the use of hormone replacement therapy. The results indicated that the increase in the incidence of breast cancer with estrogen and progestogen (compared to estrogen alone) was greater than the reduction in occurrence of endometrial cancer associated with adding progestogen to estrogen therapy. The MWS also reported a marked increase in the incidence of breast cancer with tibolone and with implanted and transdermal estrogen-only preparations [L1723].

DB09267,"Strontium ranelate has been withdrawn worldwide owing to an increased adverse cardiac effects profile along with increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and various life threatening allergic reactions.

In pooled randomised placebo-controlled studies of post-menopausal osteoporotic patients, a significant increase in myocardial infarction has been observed in patients treated with strontium ranelate compared to placebo [L1127]. Patients with significant risk factors for cardiovascular events (ie. hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking) would be susceptible to an even higher risk of cardiac ishaemic events like myocardial infarction [L1127].

In phase III placebo-controlled studies, strontium ranelate treatment was associated with an increase in the annual incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism. This places substantial risk on patients at risk of VTE and elderly (over 80 years) patients at risk of VTE who may be more commonly associated with illnesses or conditions leading to immobilisation [L1127].

Life-threatening cutaneous reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), and drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported with the use of strontium ranelate. In particular, a higher incidence of such reactions has been reported in patients of Asian origin. [L1127]

In a pooled analysis of randomised placebo-controlled studies in post-menopausal osteoporotic patients, the most common adverse reactions consisted of nausea and diarrhea [L1127].

Nevertheless, good tolerance was shown in a clinical study investigating the repeated administration of 4 g strontium ranelate per day over 25 days in healthy postmenopausal women [FDA Label]. Single administration of doses up to 11 g in healthy young male volunteers did not cause any particular symptoms [FDA Label].

In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (30-70 ml/min creatine clearance), strontium clearance decreases as creatinine clearance decreases (approximately 30% decrease over the creatinine clearance range 30 to 70 ml/min) and thereby induces an increase in strontium plasma levels. However, no dosage adjustment is required for patients with miod to moderate renal impairment - although no pharmacokinetic data exists for patients with severe renal impairment associated with creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min [L1127].

There are several conditions in which caution must be observed while administering this contrast drug [L1883]:

**Renal Disease/Hepatic Disease**


Particular attention is required if the patient has both hepatic and renal failure, which increases the risk of contrast agent retention [L1883].


**Cardiovascular Disease**
In patients with manifest or incipient heart failure, coronary disease, pulmonary hypertension, or valvular heart disease, the risks of pulmonary edema, myocardial ischemia and arrhythmia and severe hemodynamic disturbances is heightened after the administration of an iodinated contrast agent.
    
Cases of Torsade de Pointes have been identified in patients using sodium and meglumine ioxaglate, therefore loxaglic acid should be administered very carefully to patients who have/may develop prolongation of QTc, including patients taking other medicines that contribute to cardiovascular QT prolongation [L1883].

**Thyroid Disease**

Following injection of iodinated contrast agent, specifically in patients with goiter or a history of hypothyroidism, there is a risk of either an episode of hyperthyroidism or induction of a new episode of hypothyroidism. 

There is also a risk of hypothyroidism in newborns who have received, or whose mother has received, an iodinated contrast agent.
 
Screening for hypothyroidism should be performed routinely after administration of the product to newborns and judiciously to premature babies by assaying TSH and possibly free T4, 7-10 days and 1 month after iodine overload [L1883].


**Asthma**

Asthma should be controlled before injecting the iodinated contrast agent [L1883].

Particular attention is required if the asthmatic attack has occurred within eight days prior to administration of loxagic acid, because of the increased risk for bronchospasm.

**Myasthenia gravis**

Administration of a contrast agent may exacerbate the symptoms of myasthenia gravis [L1883].

Since the introduction of iopanoic acid (Telepaque) in 1951, widespread clinical application has demonstrated that this medium represents an ideal cholecystographic agent.1 Iopanoic acid [β-(3-amino-2, 4, 6-triiodophenyl)-α-ethylpropionic acid] contains 66.68% iodine.  Maximum concentration in the gallbladder occurs at from 10 to 12 hours. Iopanoic acid is excreted primarily through the intestinal tract. Its elimination is rapid and complete within 48 hours. Toxic reactions to this agent are rare, and side-effects rarely occur [L1608].

Although the foregoing oral cholecystographic agents are relatively non-toxic substances, adverse reactions such as minor gastrointestinal disturbances or allergic reactions are occasionally observed. Therefore, it is highly desirable, in order to minimize the occurrence of these undesirable side-effects, to use as low a dose as possible and maintain the blood plasma iodine concentration at the lowest possible level without sacrificing adequate imaging of the gallbladder [L1610].

A study was done on this agent in basic form and slow-release form [L1610]. The acute oral toxicity in mice of the basic formulation was determined, and a 7-day LD50 value of 5042 (3623-6596) mg/kg in terms of sodium tyropanoate was obtained. This compared to a Ld50 value of 3158 (1302-3900) for commercial sodium tyropanoate capsule mix (uncoated).

Ester-type local anesthetics are much more likely to cause an allergic reaction compared to the amide-group local anesthetics because of the formation of PABA (Para-aminobenzoic acid) during the metabolic process.

The mechanism of reserpine's toxic effects is found to be in parallel with the mechanism of its pharmacologic effects.  Reserpine inhibits sympathetic activity in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system by binding to catecholamine storage vesicles.

DB10770,"No serious adverse events were attributed to Dermagraft. Of the 314 patients enrolled in a preclinical study, 10.4% (17/163) of the patients developed an infection while 17.9% (27/151) of the control group patients developed an ulcer infection. Overall, 31/163 (19%) of the dermagraft group developed infection, cellulitis, or osteomyelitis. In the control group, 49/151 (32.5%) patients developed the same adverse events. Thus, there was a lower rate of infection, cellulitis, and osteomyelitis in the dermagraft treated group [L2418].","This device is indicated for use for the treatment of full-thickness,  diabetic foot ulcers greater than six weeks duration which extends through the dermis, but without tendon, muscle, joint capsule or bone exposure. This drug should be used in conjunction with standard wound care regimens and in patients with an adequate blood supply to the involved foot [L2418].

"
DB10771,"Elevated anti-collagen antibody levels have been detected in patients treated with clinical doses of injectable collagen, even in the absence of adverse cutaneous reactions [A32697].  Antibodies to both native type I bovine and human collagen can lead to a variety of symptoms including joint inflammation, edema at the injection site of bovine collagen implant and fever, as late as 6 months after injection [A32702], [A32703].

Products derived from bovine tissues, especially gelatine, tallow and dicalcium phosphate have been studied in relation to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and  Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (CJD) [A32698].  The risk of BSE and CJD is dependent on many factors, including the country of origin of the bovine collagen, the health of the cattle from which the collagen is obtained, and practices during processing.  Denaturation temperature is a particularly important parameter, depending on the collagen origin and hydration level [A32699]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), prolonged alkaline treatment, filtration, and heat sterilization (≥ 138o C for ≥ 4 sec) or an equivalent process on gelatin is a safe practice in preventing BSE [L2497]. 

The collagen manufacturing process may have some steps in common with the manufacture of gelatin such as alkaline and sodium sulfate treatment, calcium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide treatments or enzyme treatment. These common steps can, however, differ in duration and pH condition which can result in significant differences in their prion inactivation capacity. Manufacturers should at least conduct a process evaluation based on the similarities of the collagen processing steps, as compared to known inactivation steps in the manu­facture of gelatin, to support the safety of the product. Outside of the processing steps, differences also exist in the final use of the material and, as a result, in their risk assessment, while gelatin is widely used for oral administration, many collagen applications are in the form of implants. This should be considered in the final risk assessment of type I bovine collagen products [L2498].

According to the EMA (European medicines agency), collagen produced from tissues such as hides, skins, tendons, and sinews do not usually present a measurable TSE risk provided that contamination with potentially infected materials, for example, spillage of blood and/or central nervous tissues, is avoided during procurement. Hides represent a safer raw material for human implants derived from collagen. However, cross-contamination with brain material released during the slaughtering process, possibly dried on the surface of hides is difficult to eliminate. This is another aspect to consider in the evaluation of the safety of bovine type I collagen [L2497].
","For the management of wounds including: partial and full- thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds (donor sites/graft, post-Moh’s dermatological surgery, post-laser surgery, podiatric, wound dehiscence), trauma wounds (abrasions, lacerations, second-degree burns and skin tears) and draining wounds [L2500].

Gintuit (Allogeneic Cultured Keratinocytes and Fibroblasts in Bovine Collagen) is an allogeneic cellularized scaffold product indicated for topical (non-submerged) application to a surgically created vascular wound bed in the treatment of mucogingival conditions in adults. It uses bovine collagen as a matrix to support the growth of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in wound healing [L2450]. Other products using bovine type 1 collagen include PriMatrix, Integra, Orcel and Matriderm [L2490].

Orcel is a bilayered cellular matrix in which normal human allogeneic skin cells (both epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts) are cultured in two separate layers into a Type I bovine collagen sponge, indicated in venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot. Type I bovine collagen acts as a matrix for the growth and proliferation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes, offering structure and support [L2427].

In the laboratory, bovine Collagen Type I purified protein standard is used as a control for SDS-PAGE, Western Blot, ELISA, immunoprecipitation, and for other immunological assays [L2488]."
DB10772,"Adverse events in a preclinical study of about 300 subjects were classified as mild, moderate, severe or life-threatening. In the venous leg ulcer study, 1 life-threatening infection and 3 severe infections reported in the Apligraf group occurred, and none in the control group. Of the 4 events, 2 severe infections were related to treatment: however one occurred one month after the last application of Apligraf and the other occurred following application on a pre-existing Pseudomonas infection [L2461].
","For chronic leg ulcers and diabetic foot [L2439].  

Orcel is indicated for use with standard therapeutic compression for the treatment of non-infected partial and full-thickness skin ulcers due to venous insufficiency of greater than 1 month in duration and which have not effectively responded to conventional ulcer therapy. Orcel is also for use with standard diabetic foot ulcer care for the treatment of full-thickness neuropathic diabetic foot ulcers of greater than 3 weeks in duration which have not effectively responded to conventional ulcer therapy, and which extend through the dermis but without tendon, muscle, capsule or bone involvement [L2459].

DB10805,,"Yellow Fever Vaccine is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of yellow fever in persons 9 months of age and older in the following categories:

1. Persons Living in or Traveling to Endemic Areas: While the actual risk for contracting yellow fever during travel is probably low, variability of itineraries, behaviors and seasonal incidence of disease make it difficult to predict the actual risk for a given individual living in or traveling to a known endemic or epidemic area. Greater risk is associated with living in or traveling to areas of South America and Africa where yellow fever infection is officially reported at the time of travel and with traveling outside the urban areas of countries that do not officially report the disease but that lie in a yellow fever endemic zone.

2. Persons Travelling Internationally Through Countries with Yellow Fever: Some countries require an individual to have a valid International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) if the individual has been in countries either known or thought to harbor yellow fever virus. The certificate becomes valid 10 days after vaccination with Yellow Fever Vaccine.

3. Laboratory Personnel: Laboratory personnel who handle virulent yellow fever virus or concentrated preparations of the yellow fever vaccine virus strains may be at risk of exposure by direct or indirect contact or by aerosols."

The primary acute toxic effect of nitrates is the development of methemoglobinemia, a condition in which greater than 10% of the hemoglobin in the body is transformed into methemoglobin. When this conversion exceeds 70% the condition may result in death [L1750].

The potassium ion by itself possesses very little toxicity; the toxicity of the salts is associated with the anion. Potassium nitrate is rapidly absorbed from the upper gastrointestinal tract and is excreted mostly as the unchanged drug [L1736].   This excludes a small percentage of the ingested dose that is reduced by the microbial action of the gut to nitrite. Nitrites convert the hemoglobin in red blood cells into methemoglobin [L1736]. In male rats given potassium nitrate, intestinal absorption was affected [A32165].

Adverse increased potassium intake included changes in blood lipids, triglyceride, decreased high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol), changes in renal function, and increases in catecholamine levels. The decrease in blood volume caused by increased potassium activates the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Decreases in blood volume may also contribute to the observed changes in blood lipid concentrations [L1755].

Death and severe effects of nitrate ingestion are generally associated with doses of the drugs above 10g NO3-. Doses ranging from 2-9 g NO3- have been reported to cause methemoglobinemia. These values correspond to 33 - 150 mg NO3-/kg [L1750]
Potassium nitrate was shown to cause low to moderate acute toxicity.  Repeated dose toxicity was investigated in rats given oral doses in the range 10-100 mg/kg per day for 4 months; bronchopneumonia, local hemorrhages, and other circulatory disorders were observed in treated animals.

DB11094,"The use of pharmacological or nutraceutical vitamin d and/or even excessive dietary intake of vitamin d is contraindicated in patients with hypercalcemia, malabsorption syndrome, abnormal sensitivity to the toxic effects of vitamin d, and hypervitaminosis D [FDA Label].

Hypersensitivity to vitamin d is one plausible etiologic factor in infants with idiopathic hypercalcemia - a case in which vitamin d use must be strictly restricted [FDA Label].

As vitamin d intake is available via fortified foods, dietary supplements, and clinical drug sources, serum concentrations and therapeutic dosages should be reviewed regularly and readjusted as soon as there is clinical improvement [FDA Label]. Dosage levels are required to be individualized on an individual patient by patient basis as caution must be exercised to prevent the presence of too much vitamin d in the body and the various potentially serious toxic effects associated with such circumstances [FDA Label].

In particular, the range between therapeutic and toxic doses is quite narrow in vitamin d resistant rickets [FDA Label]. When high therapeutic doses are used, progress should be followed with frequent blood calcium determinations [FDA Label].

When treating hypoparathyroidism, intravenous calcium, parathyroid hormone, and/or dihydrotachysterol may be required [FDA Label].

Maintenance of normal serum phosphorus levels by dietary phosphate restriction and/or administration of aluminum gels as intestinal phosphate binders in those patients with hyperphosphatemia as frequently seen in renal osteodystrophy is essential to prevent metastatic calcification [FDA Label].

Mineral oil interferes with the absorption of lipid-soluble vitamins, including vitamin d preparations [FDA Label].

The administration of thiazide diuretics to hypoparathyroid patients who are concurrently being treated with vitamin d can result in hypercalcemia [FDA Label].

At this time, no long term animal studies have been performed to evaluate vitamin potential for carcinogens, mutagenesis, or fertility [FDA Label].

As various animal reproduction studies have demonstrated fetal abnormalities in several species associated with hypervitaminosis D, the use of vitamin d in excess of the recommended dietary allowance during normal pregnancy should be avoided [FDA Label]. The safety in excess of 400 USP units of vitamin d daily during pregnancy has not been established [FDA Label]. The abnormalities observed are similar to the supravalvular aortic stenosis syndrome described in infants that is characterized by supravalvular aortic stenosis, elfin facies, and mental retardation [FDA Label].

In a nursing mother given large doses of vitamin D, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol appeared in the milk and caused hypercalcemia in her child. Caution is subsequently required when contemplating the use of vitamin d in a nursing woman, and the necessity of monitoring infants' serum calcium concentration if vitamin d is administered to a breastfeeding woman [FDA Label].

Adverse reactions associated with the use of vitamin d are primarily linked to having hypervitaminosis D occurring [FDA Lanel]. In particular, hypervitaminosis D is characterized by effects specific effects on specific organ systems. At the renal system, hypervitaminosis D can cause impairment of renal function with polyuria, nocturne, polydipsia, hypercalciuria, reversible asotemia, hypertension, nephrocalcinosis, generalized vascular calcification, or even irreversible renal insufficiency which may result in death [FDA Label]. Elsewhere, hypervitaminosis D can also cause CNS mental retardation [FDA Label]. At the level of soft tissues, it can widespread calcification of the soft tissues, including the heart, blood vessels, renal tubules, and lungs [FDA Label]. In the skeletal system, bone demineralization (osteoporosis) in adults can occur while a decline in the average rate of linear growth and increased mineralization of bones, dwarfism, vague aches, stiffness, and weakness can occur in infants and children [FDA Label]. Finally, hypervitaminosis D can also lead to nausea, anorexia, and constipation at the gastrointestinal level as well as mild acidosis, anemia, or weight loss via metabolic processes [FDA Label].

A potential concern for larger concentrations of benzalkonium chloride to possibly cause corneal damage when implemented as an excipient ingredient in aqueous eye products is an issue that should be discussed between potential patents and their health care providers [L1816]. Since decreased regular blinking and tear generation in patients experiencing dry eyes due to any number of eye conditions can result in reduced dilution of applied eye drops containing the benzalkonium chloride preservative [L1816], alternative options including benzalkonium chloride-free products should be considered.

Additionally, benzalkonium chloride has been reported to cause punctate keratopathy and/or toxic ulcerative keratopathy. In addition, benzalkonium chloride may cause eye irritation and is known to discolour soft contact lenses [L1816]. There may also be the possibility of benzalkonium chloride containing eye drops to cause some stinging and pain [L1816].

There is the possibility of ototoxicity occurring when benzalkonium chloride containing ear drops are applied to the ear [L1816].

Benzalkonium chloride used as a preservative in nebulised solutions of anti-asthma drugs has been reported to cause dose-related bronchoconstriction especially in asthmatic patients and has been associated with the precipitation of respiratory arrest [L1816].

**Acute Exposure**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal cramping may occur [FDA label]. Acute exposure to barium sulfate may irritate the eyes and respiratory tract. Exposure to inhalation or other forms can affect the nervous system and lead to hypokalemia, which can contribute to cardiovascular rhythm abnormality [L1957]. Hypersensitivity, gastrointestinal transit delay, obstruction, aspiration pneumonitis and systemic embolization of barium sulfate are more serious complications of administration [FDA label]. In addition, fatalities have occurred due to aspiration pneumonitis, barium sulfate impaction, intestinal perforation with subsequent peritonitis and granuloma formation, and vasovagal and syncopal episodes [FDA label], [A32329].

**Chronic Exposure **

The lungs may be affected by repeated or prolonged exposure to dust particles, resulting in baritosis (a type of benign pneumoconiosis) [L1957]. Inhalation of barium sulfate dust may lead to a benign pneumoconiosis (""baritosis"") with conspicuous radiographic characteristics but no signs of impairment of pulmonary function [L1957].

**Intra-abdominal leakage**

Intra-abdominal leakage may occur during or after administration of barium sulfate [FDA label}. Caution is advised in several patient conditions such as fistulas, ulcer, inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis/diverticulitis, severe stenosis or obstruction of the GI tract. Patients should maintain adequate hydration for several days following a barium sulfate procedure to prevent obstruction or impaction caused by batholiths (barium sulfate stones) [L1959]. Caution is advised in patients with a history of food aspiration and in patients with diagnosed swallowing disorders [FDA label].

** A note on GI perforation**

Perforation of the colon after rectal administration of barium sulfate suspension has been reported due to the increased hydrostatic pressure of the instilled suspension, trauma to the colon from an enema tip, or forceful or deep insertion of a non-flexible enema tip. Perforation of the bowel has been followed by peritonitis, adhesions, granulomas, and death [L1958].  This is a rare occurrence.  Injury to the rectal mucosa or anal canal due to the enema tip or retention balloon is likely the most common traumatic cause of perforation during treatment. Inflation of a balloon within a stricture, neoplasm, inflamed rectum, or stoma is hazardous, and caution should be exerted [A32328]. 

**Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity**

No animal studies have been performed to evaluate the carcinogenicity of barium sulfate or potential effects on reproduction [FDA label].

Human poisoning cases indicate that a dose of 10 grams orally is fatal [L1970]. Sodium hydroxide is toxic by oral ingestion [L1965].

Sodium hydroxide is corrosive to all tissues. Concentrated vapors lead to serious damage to the eyes and respiratory system. Oral ingestion of sodium hydroxide, which occurs frequently in children, causes severe tissue necrosis, with stricture formation of the esophagus, often resulting in death. Contact with the skin may result in contact dermatitis,  hair loss, as well as necrosis due to severe irritation [L1972].

Increased incidence of esophageal carcinoma after severe intoxication with sodium hydroxide has been reported in man.

One study determined that triclocarban by itself stimulates _AroB_ (brain aromatase) gene expression only slightly, but TCC strongly enhances the overexpression of AroB that is induced by exogenous estrogen. TCC has  the potential to elevate levels of aromatase enzymes and, thereby, levels of endogenous estrogens in the developing brain [L2685].

Pyrantel should be used with caution in patients with severe malnutrition or anemia. Supportive therapy is recommended for anemic, dehydrated, or malnourished patients before administration of the drug [L1898].

Pyrantel pamoate has been placed in pregnancy category C.  This refers to the fact that animal studies have revealed adverse effects on the fetus (teratogenic/embryocidal, or other) and there are no controlled studies in women or studies in women and animals are not available. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus [L1894].Data on the use of pyrantel pamoate in pregnant women are quite limited. In mass treatment programs for which the World Health Organization (WHO) has observed that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks, WHO allows the use of pyrantel pamoate in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy, due to the fact that the effects of pyrantel on birth outcome are uncertain. The risk of treatment in pregnant women already known to have an infection needs to be balanced with the risk of disease progression if treatment were to be omitted [L1894].  Individuals with liver disease are more susceptible to the toxicity in cases of pyrantel overexposure [L1894], [L1897].  


There are no data regarding the presence of pyrantel in breast milk. Pyrantel is poorly absorbed from the GI tract; therefore, excretion into breast milk may be minimal.

The incidence of irritation of psoriatic/surrounding healthy skin is higher in patients who leave anthralin on the skin without rinsing than in those who use short-contact therapy of 2 hours or less, followed by rinsing [L1939].

If the psoriatic plaques are well circumscribed, the surrounding normal skin may be protected by the use of a coating agent such as zinc oxide ointment. Anthralin should be applied cautiously to the face and intertriginous areas due to the risk of severe skin irritation [L1979].

Aluminum Sulfate, Hydrated (ACS & FCC): ORAL (LD50):
 **Acute:** >9000 mg/kg in the mouse [MSDS]. >9000 mg/kg in the rat [MSDS].


**Acute Toxicity** 

There is little indication that aluminum is acutely toxic by oral exposure despite it is widely found in foods, drinking water, and many antacid preparations [L2149]. In 1988, a population of about 20 000 citizens of Camelford, England, was exposed to increased levels of aluminum for 5 days. The aluminum was accidentally ingested by the population from a water supply facility using aluminum sulfate for water treatment [L2149].

Some adverse effects observed were nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth ulcers, skin ulcers, skin rashes, and arthritis-type pain were observed. It was concluded in one study that the adverse effects of aluminum sulfate were primarily mild and transient. No long-lasting effects on health could be attributed to the exposures from aluminum in the drinking water during this period [L2149].

**Chronic Toxicity**

In humans, excess exposure to aluminum via dialysis water (aluminum sulfate) is a known etiological factor in several pathological conditions in patients treated with hemodialysis. Clinical symptoms and signs of aluminum toxicity include hypercalcemia, anemia, vitamin D refractory osteodystrophy, and a dialysis encephalopathy. Bone pain, pathological fractures, and proximal myopathy may occur. Aluminum has also been suggested as an etiology of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer senile and pre-senile dementia, as well amyotrophic sclerosis. Despite this, the most recent investigations have failed to confirm this hypothesis. A study in man has verified a number of possible deleterious interactions of aluminum salts with phosphorous metabolism, especially in long-term ingestion of aluminum-containing antacids [L2152].

It has been suggested that aluminum exposure is a risk factor for the development or acceleration of onset of Alzheimer disease (AD) in humans. The world health organization has completed a meta-analysis of 20 epidemiological studies done to test the hypothesis that aluminum in drinking-water is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease. Six studies on populations in Norway were considered of sufficiently high quality to meet the general criteria for exposure and outcome assessment and the adjustment for at least some confounding variables [L2149].

 Of six studies that examined the relationship between aluminum in drinking- water and dementia, three found a positive relationship, but three did not. However, each of the studies had significant deficiencies in the study design (e.g. ecological exposure assessment; failure to consider aluminum exposure from all sources and to control for important confounders, such as education, socioeconomic status, and family history; the use of surrogate outcome measures for AD; and selection bias) [L2149]. 

In general, the relative risks determined were less than 2, with large confidence intervals, when the total aluminum concentration in drinking-water was 0.1 mg/L or higher.  Due to the pathogenesis of AD and knowledge obtained from studies,  it was concluded that the present epidemiological evidence does not support a causal association between AD and aluminum in drinking-water  [L2149].

In addition to the epidemiological studies that examined the relationship between AD and aluminum in drinking-water, two studies studied cognitive dysfunction in elderly populations in relation to the levels of aluminum in drinking water. The results proved conflicting. A study of 800 male subjects, age 80-89, drinking water containing aluminum concentrations up to 98 μg/L found no relationship. The second study used “any evidence of mental impairment” as an outcome measure and found a relative risk of 1.72 at aluminum drinking-water concentrations above 85 μg/L in 250 males. Such data are insufficient to show that aluminum is a cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly [L2149].

**Note on possible risk of breast cancer**

Widespread concern has been raised regarding the exposure to aluminum in deodorant/antiperspirant products, with inconclusive results [L2165], [L2167], [L2168], [L2169]. Results from a more recent case-control study suggest an association between underarm cosmetic use and aluminum concentration in breast tissue and breast cancer. The observed association of underarm cosmetic use with breast cancer was, however, limited to women who report using the products multiple times a day before age of 30 [A32464].","Solutions containing 5 to 10% aluminum sulfate have been used as local applications to ulcers and to arrest foul discharges from mucous surfaces. Aluminum sulfate is also used in the preparation of aluminum acetate ear drops [L2149].

The major hazards encountered in the use and handling of 2-phenoxyethanol stem from its toxicologic properties. Toxic by all routes (inhalation, ingestion, and dermal contact), exposure to this very faintly aromatic, colorless, oily liquid may occur from its use as a fixative for cosmetics, perfumes, and soaps; as a bactericide and insect repellant; as a solvent for cellulose acetate,dyes, stamp pad, ball point, and specialty inks; as a chemical intermediate for carboxylic acid esters (eg, acrylate, maleate) and polymers (eg, formaldehyde, melamine); and as a preservative for human specimens used for dissection and demonstrations in anatomical studies. Effects resulting from exposure to this substance can include eye irritation, headache, tremors, and central nervous system depression. If contact with the eyes occurs, irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of tepid water for at least 15 minutes, and wash exposed skin thoroughly with soap and water. 2-Phenoxyethanol must be preheated before ignition can occur [L2623].","Antimicrobial agent used as a preservative in cosmetics [L2618], [L2619], [L2625]."

Historically, cod liver oil was often given to children because the vitamin d content in the oil had been shown to prevent or treat vitamin D deficiency and condition of rickets associated with it [A33159]. Over time, this common use in children growing up may have conferred upon cod liver oil its identity as a healthy and useful all-purpose dietary supplement.

However, since cod liver oil is a composite of several other nutritional compounds including the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as well as vitamin A and vitamin D [A33159, L2872, L2871], the presence in varying amounts of all of these compounds at once makes it difficult to recommend or use cod liver oil as an appropriate supplement to confer any one particular health effect or for any one particular nutritional deficiency.

Regardless, because it does contain a combination of a number of important and healthy nutritional compounds, cod liver oil has sometimes been recommended in the literature for conferring the health effects of some of these compounds, such as the potential use of cod liver oil supplements in post-heart attack patients for secondary prophylaxis associated with the use of omega-3 fatty acids [A33165]."
DB11323,"Acute ingestion of > 150 mg/kg of salicylates may result in severe toxicity. Salicylate tablets may form stomach bezoars, prolonging absorption of the drug and toxicity. Chronic toxicity can occur after several days or more of high therapeutic doses; it is common, often undiagnosed, and often more serious than acute toxicity. Chronic toxicity is likely to occur in elderly patients [L2692].

Treatment for salicylate poisoning consists of activated charcoal and alkaline diuresis with extra KCl [L2692].

Unless contraindicated (eg, by altered mental status), activated charcoal is administered as soon as possible and, if bowel sounds are active and there is adequate gastrointestinal motility, may be repeated every 4 hours until charcoal appears in the stool [L2692].

After volume and electrolyte abnormalities are corrected and maintained, alkaline diuresis can be used to increase urine pH, ideally to ≥ 8. Alkaline diuresis is advised for patients with any symptoms of poisoning and should not be delayed until salicylate levels are determined. This process is usually safe and greatly increases the rate of salicylate excretion. Because hypokalemia can interfere with alkaline diuresis, patients are often given a solution composed of 1 L of 5% D/W, 3 50-mEq ampules of NaHCO3, and 40 mEq of KCl at 1.5 to 2 times the maintenance IV fluid rate. Serum potassium levels are monitored. Due to the fact that fluid overload can lead to the occurrence of pulmonary edema, patients are monitored for respiratory findings [L2692].

Drugs that increase urinary HCO3 (eg, acetazolamide) must be avoided because they worsen metabolic acidosis and decrease blood pH. Drugs that decrease respiratory drive should be avoided when possible because they may impair hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis, decreasing blood pH [L2694].",This drug is only recommended for topical usages for the relief of muscular and rheumatic pain in human and animals [L2687].

DB11582,"Has been shown to cause chromosomal aneuploidy and male infertility. Should be avoided during all stages of pregnancy, lactation and puberty.  Is a potential risk factor for cancer. 

In 2013, The European Medical Association (EMA) mandated that the use of thiocolchicoside-containing medicines by mouth or injection should be restricted across the European Union (EU). These drugs are now recommended only as an add-on treatment for painful muscle contractures resulting from spinal conditions in adults and adolescents 16 years old and older.  Additionally, the dose of thiocolchicoside by mouth or injection should be limited.  This is due to experimental evidence suggesting that thiocolchicoside was metabolized into M2 or SL59.0955,  that has the propensity to damage dividing cells, resulting in aneuploidy (an abnormal number or arrangement of chromosomes). As a result, the CHMP (committee for medicinal products for human use) examined the safety profile of this medicine and consider what regulatory action might be appropriate [L1656].

The CHMP reviewed the evidence, with consideration of opinions from experts in medicines safety, and concluded that aneuploidy may occur with M2 at levels not significantly greater than those measured after recommended doses of thiocolchicoside ingested orally. Aneuploidy is a strong risk factor for fetal harm, decreased fertility in men, and could theoretically increase the risk of developing cancer [L1656].

The maximum recommended oral dose is 8 mg every 12 hours; treatment length should not exceed 7 consecutive days. When given intramuscularly (IM), the maximum dose is 4 mg every 12 hours, for a maximum of 5 days [L1656].

In addition to the above toxicity, a study was done on the hepatotoxic potential of thiocolchicoside.  It was observed that serum AST and ALT levels increased following of the administration oral thiocolchicoside at 8 mg/day. Two weeks after discontinuing thiocolchicoside therapy, liver enzymes had decreased to levels within the normal range. Although infrequent, thiocolchicoside should be considered a rare hepatotoxic agent in clinical practice [A32121].","
Thiocolchicoside is a  skeletal muscle-relaxant drug used in the treatment of orthopedic, traumatic and rheumatologic disorders [L1661].

Overdoses of pipradrol hydrochloride cause nausea, anxiety, insomnia and abdominal pain, however, these symptoms often disappear when the drug is withdrawn.

There are increasing reports that D2PM (desoxy analogue of pipradrol) and  2-DPMP (a pyrrolidine analogue of pipradrol) are used in Europe as drugs of abuse. 2-DPMP has sympathomimetic properties similar to cocaine and, in addition, prolonged and clinically significant neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported [L2519].

**Carbon Monoxide Toxicity from Food Ingestion Treated with Carbon Monoxide**

Very little information has been published in the literature on the consumer’s exposure to CO-packaged meat. The toxicological aspects of CO used in MAP of meat were reviewed by Sørheim et al. [A32747], and they concluded that, with up to about 0.5% of CO, no human toxicity is likely. It has been suggested that the consumption of CO-treated meat is not associated with any health risks, and meat from CO-MAP results only in negligible amounts of CO and COHb in humans [L2546], [L2548].

**Mechanism of CO Toxicity**

Once CO is inhaled, it binds with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) with an affinity of 200 times greater than oxygen that leads to decreased oxygen-carrying capacity and the decreased release of oxygen to tissues, causing tissue hypoxia. Ischemia occurs with CO poisoning when there is a loss of consciousness combined with hypotension and ischemia in the arterial border areas of the brain. Besides binding to many heme-containing proteins, CO interrupts oxidative metabolism, leading to the formation of free radicals. Once hypotension and unconsciousness occur with CO poisoning, lipid peroxidation and apoptosis soon follow [A32730].

Failure to diagnose CO poisoning may result in morbidity and mortality and allow for continued exposure to a dangerous environment. The management of CO poisoning begins with inhalation of supplemental oxygen therapy and aggressive supportive measures. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) accelerates the dissociation of CO from hemoglobin [A32729].

The concentration, exposure time and physical activity of the individual will determine the percentage conversion of haemoglobin to carboxyhaemoglobin. The effects produced depend on the degree and duration of saturation of blood with carbon monoxide [L2542].

**Levels of Intoxication with Carbon Monoxide** [A32730]

The first symptoms of carbon monoxide exposure when carboxyhemoglobin is 15-30% are generalized, and may include: headache, dizziness, nausea, fatigue, and impaired manual dexterity. Individuals with ischemic heart disease may suffer from chest pain and decreased exercise duration at COHb levels measured from 1% - 9% [A32730].

COHb levels between  30-70% lead to loss of consciousness and eventually death [A32730].

**Long-term Effects** [A32730]

Following the resolution of the acute symptoms, there may be a lucid interval from 2-40 days before the development of delayed neurologic sequelae (DNS). Diffuse brain demyelination combined with lethargy, behavioral changes, memory loss, and parkinsonian features may occur. 75% of patients with DNS recover within 1 year. Neuropsychologic abnormalities with chronic CO exposure are found even when magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings are normal. White-matter damage in the centrum semiovale and periventricular area of the brain, and abnormalities in the globus pallidus, are most commonly observed on MRI following CO toxicity. Though less common, toxic or ischemic peripheral neuropathies are associated with high levels of CO exposure in humans. The basis for the management of CO poisoning is 100% hyperbaric oxygen therapy using a tight-fitting mask for at least 6 hours. The indications for treatment with hyperbaric oxygen to decrease the half-life of COHb remain controversial [A32730].","Used as a marker of respiratory status in spirometry tests [L2557], [F4].

At the same time, the experiencing a situation characterized by excessive amounts of galactose in the body defines the challenge with galactosemia, which is itself a rare genetic metabolic disorder. In individuals with galactosemia, the enzymes needed for further metabolism of galactose (ie. such as galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase) are severely diminished or missing entirely, leading to toxic levels of galactose 1-phosphate in various tissues [A32875]. This toxic excess typically results in hepatomegaly, cirrhosis, renal failure, cataracts, vomiting, hypoglycemia, lethargy, brain damage, and ovarian failure [A32875]. Without treatment, mortality in infants with galactosemia is about 75% [A32876].","There are limited therapeutic uses for which galactose is formally indicated.

**Neurotoxicity**

In a one-dose neuronal toxicity study with esketamine intranasal administration to adult female rats, no finding of neuronal vacuolation in the brain occurred with doses up to the equivalent of the maximum recommended human dose of 84 mg/day. In a second single dose neurotoxicity study performed with intranasal esketamine administration in adult female rats, no observation of neuronal necrosis up to a dose equivalent to the maximum recommended human dose was made.

**A note on dependence and tolerance**

Reports of physical dependence have been made following prolonged use of ketamine.  Withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or significant dosage reduction of a drug is a common manifestation of drug dependence. There were no withdrawal symptoms observed up to 4 weeks in subjects after stopping esketamine treatment. Withdrawal symptoms have been observed after the discontinuation of frequently used (more than weekly) high doses of ketamine for a longer duration. These symptoms of withdrawal have a higher chance of occurring if esketamine was similarly abused.[L12999]

Symptoms of withdrawal reported to be associated with daily intake of high ketamine doses include craving, fatigue, poor appetite, and anxiety. Therefore, monitor esketamine-treated patients for symptoms and signs of physical dependence upon the discontinuation of the drug. Tolerance has been reported with prolonged use of ketamine. Tolerance is characterized by a decreased response to a drug following repeated doses (i.e., a higher dose of a drug is required to produce the same effect that was previously achieved at a lower dose). Comparable tolerance would be expected to occur with long-term use of esketamine.[L12999]

The potential risk to the fetus outweighs the potential benefit to the mother from sarecycline use during pregnancy; therefore, pregnant patients should discontinue sarecyclin as soon as pregnancy is recognized [FDA Label].

Tetracyclines are excreted in human milk [FDA Label]. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions on bone and tooth development in nursing infants from tetracycline-class antibiotics, advise a woman that breastfeeding is not recommended with sarecycline therapy [FDA Label].

Avoid using sarecycline in males who are attempting to conceive a child [FDA Label]. In a fertility study in rats, sarecycline adversely affected spermatogenesis when orally administered to male rats at a dose 8 times the MRHD (based on AUC comparison) [FDA Label].

The safety and effectiveness of sarecycline have been established in pediatric patients 9 years of age and older for the treatment of moderate to severe inflammatory lesions of non-nodular acne vulgaris [FDA Label]. The safety and effectiveness of sarecycline in pediatric patients below the age of 9 years has not been established [FDA Label]. Use of tetracycline-class antibiotics below the age of 8 is not recommended due to the potential for tooth discoloration [FDA Label].

Clinical studies of sarecycline did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects [FDA Label].

In case of overdosage, discontinue medication, treat symptomatically, and institute supportive measures [FDA Label]. Dialysis does not alter serum half-life and thus would not be of benefit in treating cases of overdose [FDA Label].

When siponimod was administered orally (0, 2, 20, or 200 mg/kg) to male rats (mated with untreated females) before and throughout the mating period, there was a dose-related increase in the precoital interval at any dose. A decrease in implantation sites, an increase in preimplantation loss, and a decrease in the number of viable fetuses were noted at the highest dose tested. The higher no-effect dose for adverse effects on fertility (20 mg/kg) is approximately 100 times the recommended human dose [FDA label].

When siponimod was administered orally (0, 0.1, 0.3, or 1 mg/kg) to female rats (mated with untreated males) prior to and during mating, and continuing to Day 6 of gestation, no effects on fertility were noted up to the highest dose studied (1 mg/kg). Plasma siponimod exposure (AUC) at the highest dose studied is about 16 times that in humans at the recommended human dose [FDA label]. 

**Use in pregnancy and lactation**

Siponimod may cause fetal harm, based on the results of animal studies. Because it takes about 10 days to eliminate this drug from the body, women of childbearing potential should use adequate contraception to avoid pregnancy during and for 10 days after the cessation of treatment [FDA label]. 
No data currently exist regarding the presence of siponimod in human milk [FDA label]. A study in lactating rats demonstrated excretion of the drug and/or its metabolites in milk. The benefits nursing should be considered as well as the mother’s clinical requirement for this drug and any possible adverse effects on the breastfed infant from siponimod [FDA label].","This drug is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease in adults [FDA label]."

While individuals experiencing mild to moderate silver toxicity remain asymptomatic, chronic inhalation has been associated with mild chronic bronchitis and rare cases of exposure to large amounts of silver have been associated with symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, decreased mental status, and seizures [L2853]. Argyria is a detoxification mechanism for excess silver where the body sequesters and deposits excess silver in the blood vessels and connective tissue to render it in the form of silver protein complexes or silver sulphide [A33141, L2853]. The development of argyria through occupational exposure is reported to be a slow process [L2853]. While argyria does not cause significant pathological damage in any tissue [A33138], heavy deposition of insoluble silver precipitates can cause discoloration or blue-grey darkening of the eyes, nasal septum, throat, skin, and other internal organs following repeated exposure [L2853]. Signs from prolonged intake of low doses of silver compound may include fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys, and changes in blood cells [A33141]. Silver may cause metal fume fever, and colloidal silver preparations are known to exert harmful effects in humans [L2853].

**Overdose information**

Iron containing products are the primary cause of drug overdose in children under 6 years of age.[L11767] Iron is toxic to the gastrointestinal system, cardiovascular system, in addition to central nervous system. The most early reported effects following the excess ingestion of iron include nausea, flatulence, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and black/tarry stools.[L2234] Symptoms of overdose in the later stages include bluish lips, fingernails, and palms, drowsiness, tachycardia, seizures, metabolic acidosis, hepatic injury, and cardiovascular dysfunction. Sequelae of iron sulfate overdose include intestinal obstruction, pyloric stenosis, and gastric scarring.[L2240] If the patient is comatose or seizing, gastric lavage with sodium bicarbonate should be performed. Deferoxamine is the antidote for iron poisoning. Other supportive treatments to support fluid and electrolyte balance and correct metabolic acidosis are also advised.[L2240] Hospitalization should continue for 24 h after the patient becomes asymptomatic to monitor for delayed onset of shock/gastrointestinal bleeding.

Toxicity from overdose is rare but may result from intentional ingestion of potassium. Iatrogenic overdoses may occur [L2653].

Local irritation after ingestion causes GI upset. Severe hyperkalemia after large IV or oral overdoses causes muscular dysfunction including weakness, paralysis, cardiac dysrhythmias, and rarely death [L2653].


**Mild to moderate toxicity**

Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, paresthesias, and muscle cramps are common. Rarely, gastrointestinal bleed may occur.


**Severe toxicity**

In severe toxicity, muscular weakness progressing to paralysis may occur. Cardiac arrhythmia often occur at concentrations greater than 8 mEq/L and death from cardiac arrest at concentrations of 9 to 12 mEq/L or higher. Characteristic ECG findings occur in the following order: peaked T waves, QRS complex blends into the T wave, PR interval prolongation, P wave is lost and ST segments depress, merging S and T waves, and finally, sine waves. The presence of the sine wave is a near terminal event, signaling that hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest are near. As serum hyperkalemia is corrected towards normal concentrations, the ECG changes resolve in reverse order [L2653].","Because of potassium’s wide-ranging roles in the body, low intakes can increase the risk of illness [L2655].

Potassium supplements are indicated to prevent hypokalemia in patients who would be at particular risk if hypokalemia were to develop (e.g., digitalis treated patients with significant cardiac arrhythmias). Potassium deficiency occurs when the rate of loss through renal excretion and/or loss from the gastrointestinal tract is higher than the rate of potassium intake. In addition to serving as a preventative supplement, potassium gluconate also serves as a treatment for decreased potassium levels [L2655], [L2651], [L2657]."

Excess magnesium from dietary sources does not pose a health risk in healthy individuals because the kidneys eliminate excess amounts of magnesium in the urine. On the other hand, high doses of magnesium from dietary supplements or medications often result in diarrhea that can be combined with nausea and abdominal cramping. Forms of magnesium most commonly reported to cause diarrhea include magnesium carbonate, chloride, gluconate, and oxide. Diarrheal and laxative effects of magnesium salts are due to the osmotic activity of unabsorbed salts in the intestine and colon and the stimulation of gastric motility [L2606].

Hypermagnesaemia after oral ingestion is uncommon except in patients with renal impairment. Signs and symptoms of hypermagnesemia may include respiratory depression, loss of deep tendon reflexes due to neuromuscular blockade, nausea, vomiting, flushing, hypotension, drowsiness, bradycardia and muscle weakness. 

Very high doses of magnesium-containing laxatives and antacids (normally providing more than 5,000 mg/day magnesium) have been associated with the occurrence of magnesium toxicity, including fatal hypermagnesemia in a 28-month-old boy as well as an elderly man. Symptoms of magnesium toxicity, normally presenting at concentrations of 1.74–2.61 mmol/L, may include hypotension, nausea, vomiting, facial flushing, retention of urine, ileus, depression, and lethargy before progressing to muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, extreme hypotension, irregular heartbeat, and cardiac arrest. The risk of magnesium toxicity increases with compromised renal function or kidney failure because the ability to remove excess magnesium is reduced or lost [L2601].

Treatment: In patients with normal renal function, IV fluids or furosemide may be administered to promote the excretion of magnesium. In patients with symptomatic hypermagnesaemia, slow IV injection of calcium gluconate can be administered to antagonize the cardiac and neuromuscular effects of magnesium [L2606].","Magnesium gluconate is a mineral supplement which is used to prevent and treat low levels of magnesium. Magnesium is very important for the normal physiologic functioning of cells, nerves, muscles, bones, and the heart. Generally, a well-balanced diet provides the necessary amounts of magnesium for homeostasis. However, certain conditions causing chronic magnesium deficiency may decrease levels of magnesium. These conditions include treatment with diuretics, a poor diet, alcoholism, or other medical conditions (e.g., severe diarrhea/vomiting, stomach/intestinal absorption problems, poorly controlled diabetes) [L2600]."

There are no reports of overdose with tilactase.[L2345],"Tilactase is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of lactose intolerance in infants and older patients requiring a parenteral nutrition or fluid diet.[L2338]

Lactose intolerance occurs when there is an existence of an inability to break down lactose which is commonly found in dairy products.

Fenofibric acid is contraindicated for: (a) patients with severe renal impairment, including those receiving dialysis, (b) patients with active liver disease, including those with primary biliary cirrhosis and unexplained persistent liver function abnormalities, (c) patients with preexisting gallbladder disease, (d) patients with known hypersensitivity to fenofibric acid or Fenofibrate, and (e) nursing mothers [FDA Label].

The relationship between the use of fenofibric acid and risk of mortality and coronary heart disease morbidity has not been formally established [FDA Label]. However, a number of studies involving fenofibrate and agents that are chemically and pharmacologically similar to fenofibrate demonstrate inconclusive results. In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, a non-significant 11% (HR 1.11 [0.95, 1.29], p=0.18) and 19% (HR 1.19 [0.90, 1.57], p=0.22) increase in total and coronary heart disease mortality, respectively, with Fenofibrate as compared to placebo [FDA Label]. For the Coronary Drug Project, a large study of post myocardial infarction of patients treated for 5 years with clofibrate, there was a difference in the rate of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis requiring surgery between the clofibrate and placebo groups of 3.0% vs. 1.8%, respectively [FDA Label]. The World Health Organization (WHO) also conducted a study in which 5000 subjects without known coronary artery disease were treated with placebo or clofibrate for 5 years and followed for an additional year [FDA Label]. The results involved a statistically significant, higher age-adjusted all-cause mortality in the clofibrate group compared with the placebo group (5.70% vs. 3.96%, p<0.01) in which excess mortality was due to a 33% increase in non-cardiovascular causes, including malignancy, post-cholecystectomy complications, and pancreatitis [FDA Label]. With the Helsinki Heart Study, 4081 middle aged men without a history of coronary artery disease were given either placebo or gemfibrozil for 5 years, with a 3.5 year open extension afterward [FDA Label]. Although total mortality was numerically higher in the gemfibrozil arm, it was statistically significant (p=0.19, 95% confidence interval for relative risk = 0.91-1.64). Finally, a secondary prevention component of the Helsinki Heart Study observed middle aged men not included in the primary prevention study because they had known or suspected coronary heart disease [FDA Label]. When these subjects were administered gemfibrozil or placebo therapy for 5 years, cardiac deaths trended higher in the gemfibrozil group but was ultimately not statistically significant (HR 2.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.94-5.05) [FDA Label].

Fibrates facilitate the risk for myopathy and have been associated with rhabdomyolysis [FDA Label]. The risk for serious muscle toxicity appears to be increased in elderly patients and in patients with diabetes, renal failure, or hypothyroidism [FDA Label]. Myopathy should be considered in any patient with diffuse myalgia, muscle tenderness or weakness, and/or marked elevations of creatine phosphokinase levels [FDA Label].

Fenofibrate administered across a range of doses with the higher dose equivalent to 105 mg fenofibric acid has been associated with increases in serum transaminases like AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) [FDA Label]. In a pooled analysis of 10 placebo-controlled trials, increases to more than 3 times the upper limit of normal of ALT occurred in 5.3% of patients taking Fenofibrate versus 1.1% of patients treated with placebo [FDA Label]. If enzyme levels persist above three times the normal limit, therapy is to be discontinued [FDA Label]. After discontinuing fenofibrate treatment or during continued treatment a return to normal transaminase limits was usually observed [FDA Label]. The incidence of increases in transaminases observed with fenofibrate therapy appear to be dose related [FDA Label]. From an 8 week dose-ranging study, the incidence of ALT or AST elevations to at least three times the upper limit of normal was 13% in patients receiving dosages equivalent to 35 mg to 105 mg fenofibric acid per day and was comparatively 0% in those receiving placebo or doses equivalent to 35 mg or less fenofibric acid per day [FDA Label]. Hepatocellular, chronic active and cholestatic hepatitis associated with Fenofibrate therapy have been reported after exposures of weeks to several years [FDA Label]. In extremely rare cases, cirrhosis has been reported in associated with chronic active hepatitis [FDA Label].

Increases in serum creatinine have been reported in patients on Fenofibrate [FDA Label]. These elevations tend to return to baseline following discontinuation of the drug [FDA Label]. Although the clinical significance of these observations is unknown, renal monitoring should be considered for patients with renal impairment and for patients at risk for renal insufficiency, perhaps like patients with diabetes or the elderly [FDA Label].

Fenofibric acid may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis [FDA Label]. If gallstones are found, fenofibric acid should be discontinued [FDA Label].

Caution must be exercised over the ability of fenofibric acid to potentiate the anticoagulant effects of coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in prolongation of the prothrombin time/International Normalized Ratio (PT/INR) [FDA Label].

Pancreatitis has also been reported in patients taking Fenofibrate [FDA Label]. This effect may be caused by the failure of efficacy in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, a direct drug effect, or a secondary phenomenon mediated through biliary tract stone or sludge formation with obstruction of the common bile duct [FDA Label].

Mild to moderate hemoglobin, hematocrit, and white blood cell decreases have been observed in patients following the start of fenofibrate therapy [FDA Label]. However, although these levels tend to stabilize during long-term administration of the medication [FDA Label], thrombocytopenia and agranulocytosis have been observed in patients treated with fenofibrates as well [FDA Label]. Scheduled monitoring of red and white blood cell counts during the first 12 months of fenofibric acid administration is subsequently recommended [FDA Label].

Acute hypersensitivity reactions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis requiring patient hospitalization and treatment with steroids have been reported in patients treated with fenofibrates [FDA Label].

In the fenofibrate arm during the FIELD trial, occurrences of pulmonary embolus (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) were recorded at higher rates when compared to the placebo group [FDA Label]. In particular, the placebo group had N=4900 and the fenofibrate group N=4895 [FDA Label]. For DVT there were 48 events (1%) in the placebo group and 67 (1%) in the fenofibrate group with p=0.074 [FDA Label]. While for PE, there were 32 (0.7%) events in the placebo group and 53 (1%) in the fenofibrate group with p=0.022 [FDA Label]. Likewise, in the Coronary Drug Project, a higher proportion of the clofibrate group reported definite or suspected fatal or nonfatal PE or thrombophlebitis when compared to the placebo group (5.2% vs 3.3% at 5 years with p<0.01) [FDA Label].

Additionally there have been postmarketing and clinical trial reports of serious paradoxical decreases in HDL cholesterol levels to as low as 2 mg/dL happening in diabetic and non-diabetic patients initiated on fibrate therapy [FDA Label]. This decrease in HDL-C is accompanied by a decrease in apolipoprotein A1. Such decreases have been reported to occur within 2 weeks to years after initiation of fibrate therapy [FDA Label]. The HDL-C levels remain depressed until fibrate therapy has been withdrawn; the response to withdrawal of fibrate therapy is in fact rapid and sustained [FDA Label]. HDL-C levels are recommended to be checked within the first few months after initiation of fibrate therapy. In the case of severely depressed HDL-C levels being detected, fibrate therapy should be withdrawn and HDL-C levels monitored until it has returned to baseline with no intention or plan to re-initiate fibrate therapy [FDA Label].

Adverse effects associated with the use of fenofibrate and fenofibric acid include abdominal pain, back pain, headache, nausea, constipation, abnormal liver tests, increased AST, increased ALT, increased creatine phosphokinase, respiratory disorder, rhinitis, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nasopharyngitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, and/or dizziness [FDA Label, L1526].

Adverse effects identified during the post-approval use period of fenofibrate include rhabdomyolysis, panrcreatitis, renal failure, muscle spasms, acute renal failure, hepatitis, cirrhosis, anemia, asthenia, and severely depressed HDL-cholesterol levels [L1526].

As Fenofibric acid has the capability to potentiate the anticoagulant effect of coumarin anticoagulants (and subsequently prolong the PT/INR of patients), caution should be exercised when oral coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with fenofibric acid. Frequent PT/INR determinations are therefore advisable until stabilized PT/INR readings are obtained
[FDA Label, L1526].

Fenofibric acid should be administered to patients at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after a bile acid resin is given as such drugs may bind other agents being given concurrently and impede their absorption [FDA Label, L1526].

Immunosuppressant medications like cyclosporine and tacrolimus can cause nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the main elimination route for fenofibric acid, there exists a risk that an interaction could lead to deterioration of renal function [FDA Label, L1526]. As a consequence, the benefits and risks of using fenofibric acid with any other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered and the lowest effective dose employed [FDA Label, L1526].

Cases of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with fenofibrates co-administered with colchicine, and caution should be exercised when considering the combination use of fenofibrates with colchicine [FDA Label, L1526].

No well controlled studies regarding the use of fenofibric acid in pregnant women have been established [FDA Label, L1526]. Since the safety of fenofibric acid in pregnant women has not been formally elucidated, fenofibric acid should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus [FDA Label, L1526].

Moreover, fenofibric acid should not be used in nursing mothers. Under the circumstances, a decision should be made between having to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the use of fenofibric acid, taking into perspective the importance of the drug therapy to the mother [FDA Label, L1526].

The safety and effectiveness of fenofibric acid in paediatric patients has not been formally established [FDA Label, L1526].

Fenofibric acid is predominantly excreted by the kidney system unchanged or as fenofibric acid glucuronide [FDA Label, L1526]. The risk of experiencing adverse reactions associated with exposure to fenofibric acid may consequently be greater in patients with impaired renal function [FDA Label, L1526]. Subsequently, because elderly patients may have a higher incidence of renal impairment, the dosage of fenofibric acid for geriatric patients should be based upon renal function, with normal renal function requiring no dosage modifications [FDA Label, L1526]. Renal function monitoring in elderly patients taking fenofibric acid is recommended [FDA Label, L1526].

In patients with severe renal impairment, the use of fenofibric acid is to be avoided while dose reductions is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment [FDA Label, L1526]. Monitoring renal function in patients with renal impairment is recommended [FDA Label, L1526].

The use of fenofibric acid has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment [FDA Label, L1526].

In a 24 month study, Wistar rats were dosed at various levels of fenofibrate. At a dose of 200mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] based on body surface area comparisons mg/m2), the incidence of liver carcinomas was significantly increased in both sexes of the rats [FDA Label, L1526]. At doses of 10 (0.3 times the MRHD) and 200 mg/kg/day, a statistically significant increase in pancreatic carcinomas was observed in males, and an increase in pancreatic adenomas and benign testicular interstitial cell tumours were observed at 200 mg/kg/day in males [FDA Label, L1526]. In a second 24 month study on the Sprague-Dawley strain of rats, doses of 10 and 60 mg/kg/day produced significant increases in the incidence of pancreatic acinar adenomas in both sexes of the rats and increases in interstitial cell tumours of the testes at 2 times the MRHD [FDA Label, L1526].

In addition, fenofibrate 10 and 60 mg/kg/day, clofibrate 400 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD), and gemfibrozil 250 mg/kg/day (2 times the MRHD) are studied in a 117 week study in rats. Fenofibrate increased pancreatic acing adenomas in both sexes of the rats [FDA Label, L1526]. Clofibrate increased hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic acinar adenomas in males and hepatic neoplastic nodules in females [FDA Label, L1526]. And finally, gemfibrozil increased hepatic neoplastic nodules in males and females, while all three drugs increased testicular interstitial cell tumours in males [FDA Label, L1526].

In a 21 month study with CF-1 mice, fenofibrate 10, 45, and 200 mg/kg/day (approximately 0.2, 1, and 3 times the MRHD) significantly increased the liver carcinomas in both sexes at 3 times the MRHD [FDA Label, L1526]. With a second 18 month study at 10, 60, and 200 mg/kg/day, fenofibrate significantly increased the liver carcinomas in male and female mice 3 times the MRHD [FDA Label, L1526].

**Aseptic meningitis syndrome**

An aseptic meningitis syndrome (AMS) has been reported to occur infrequently in association with Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) (IGIV) treatment. The syndrome normally begins within several hours to 2 days after treatment. This syndrome is characterized by symptoms and signs including severe headache, nuchal rigidity, drowsiness, fever, photophobia, painful eye movements, and nausea and vomiting [FDA label]. 

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies are frequently positive with pleocytosis up to several thousand cells per cu.mm., predominantly from the granulocytic series, and elevated protein levels up to several hundred mg/dL. Patients experiencing such symptoms and signs must receive a thorough neurological assessment, including CSF studies, to rule out other possible causes of meningitis. This condition may occur more frequently in association with high doses (2 g/kg or greater) of IGIV treatment. Discontinuation of IGIV treatment has been followed by the remission of aseptic meningitis syndrome within several days without long-term sequelae [FDA label].

The most commonly reported side effects are gastrointestinal discomfort and rashes, both of which have shown to be mild and transient. Some other adverse effects in clinical trials have included breast pain or enlargement, infection, vaginal bleeding or spotting, and musculoskeletal discomfort. The incidence of these symptoms, however, was similar in women taking black cohosh and those taking a placebo.[L2303]

Reports have been made globally of at least 83 cases of liver damage—including hepatitis, liver failure, elevated liver enzymes, and various other liver injuries—associated with black cohosh use.

Screening for possible previous exposure to murine monoclonal antibodies and tests for the presence of HAMA in prospective patients should be made prior to administrating besilesomab [FDA Label]. Moreover, because the incidence of developing HAMA appears to be dose related with besilesomab, the recommended dosage is restricted to no more than 250 micrograms of antibody per injection [T132]. Patients who are HAMA positive are consequently contraindicated from using besilesomab [FDA Label].

Hypersensitivity to besilesomab or to any other murine antibodies or to any of the excipients associated with the active besilesomab radio-diagnostic agent is subsequently a contraindication [FDA Label].

Some patients have also reported hypotension as a common adverse reaction [FDA Label].

As exposure to ionizing radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for developing hereditary defects, the use of radio-diagnostic besilesomab in pregnant women is considered a formal contraindication [FDA Label]. If in doubt about a woman's potential pregnancy, alternative techniques to not using ionizing radiation should be considered and/or offered instead to the patient [FDA Label].

Moreover, although it is not known if besilesomab is excreted in human milk, the potential risk to a breast-fed child cannot be excluded [FDA Label]. Furthermore, while consideration should be given to the possibility of perhaps delaying the administration of radionuclide agents until the mother has ceased breastfeeding or perhaps certainly choosing alternative radoopharmaceuticals with more appropriate secretion activity, if the use of besilesomab is absolutely necessary then the mother's breastfeeding should be stopped for three days and any expressed feeds during that time discarded [FDA Label]. The time period of three days corresponds to 10 half-lives of technetium (Tc99m)(60 hours) [FDA Label]. At that time, the remaining activity represents about 1/1000 of the initial activity in the body [FDA Label].

In general, close contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted for patients who have been administered besilesomab during the first 12 hours after the injection [FDA Label].

Since besilesomab contains sorbitol, patients having any rare hereditary conditions of fructose intolerance should not be administered this medicine [FDA Label].

Because no sufficient data regarding the safety and efficacy of using besilesomab in children below the age of 18 years exists, the use of besilesomab in this patient population is not recommended [L1711].

Even though data regarding the repeated dosing of besilesomab is extremely limited, the use of besilesomab should only be used once in a patient's lifetime [FDA Label].

Other medicines that can inhibit inflammation or affect the hematopoietic system (like antibiotics and corticosteroids) can lead to false negative results. Such agents should therefore not be administered together with, or a short time before the injection of besilesomab [FDA Label].

Preclinical data obtained with the non-radioactive compound revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, single-dose and repeated dose toxicity, although antimurine antibodies were found in all dose groups (including controls) in a repeated-dose study in monkeys [FDA Label]. Genotoxicity studies conducted to test for potentially genotoxic impurities were also negative. Long-term carcinogenicity studies and toxicity to reproduction have not yet been carried out [FDA Label].","Besilesomab is radiolabelled with sodium pertechnetate (Tc99m) solution to develop technetium (Tc99m) besilesomab solution.

Iron deficiency appears when the dietary intake does not meet the body's requirement or when there is chronic external blood loss. During acute blood loss, body iron stores are sufficient for accelerated erythropoiesis and restoration of iron homeostasis. But when the altered homeostasis remains for weeks to months then some supplement is needed.

It is generally believed that alpha-tocopherol succinate is ultimately de-esterified or cleaved to provide alpha-tocopherol once administered to the human body [F47]. It is consequently expected that pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics similar to that of alpha-tocopherol to be followed [F47].","The primary health-related use for which alpha-tocopherol succinate is formally indicated is as a dietary supplement for patients who demonstrate a genuine vitamin E deficiency. At the same time, vitamin E deficiency is generally quite rare but may occur in premature babies of very low birth weight (< 1500 grams), individuals with fat-malabsorption disorders (as fat is required for the digestive tract to absorb vitamin E), or individuals with abetalipoproteinemia - a rare, inherited disorder that causes poor absorption of dietary fat - who require extremely large doses of supplemental vitamin E daily (around 100 mg/kg or 5-10 g/day) [L2120]. In all such cases, alpha-tocopherol is largely the preferred form of vitamin E to be administered.

Elsewhere, vitamin E's chemical profile as a fat-soluble antioxidant that is capable of neutralizing free radicals in the body continues to generate ongoing interest and study regarding how and whether or not the vitamin can help prevent or delay various chronic diseases associated with free radicals or other potential biological effects that vitamin E possesses like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, ocular conditions, immune illnesses, cancer, and more [T166]. None of these ongoing studies have yet to elucidate any formally significant evidence, however [T166].

Similarly, more effective clinical trials are necessary to confirm what has only been accrued as preliminary data when it comes to studies proposing the demonstration of alpha-tocopherol succinate's capability to act as an anti-cancer therapy or as a regulator of inflammation [L2699, A32958, A32959]."

Vitamin E, known for its antioxidant activities, is protective against cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer and has also demonstrated immune-enhancing effects. It may be of limited benefit in some with asthma and rheumatoid arthritis. It may be helpful in some neurological diseases including Alzheimer's, some eye disorders including cataracts, and diabetes and premenstrual syndrome.

It is advisable to perform tests for current tuberculosis status, as this drug may lead to reactivation of latent infection [FDA label].

A common issue for monoclonal antibody drugs is the development of antibodies to the drugs, thus rendering them less effective or completely ineffective [L1861]. A clinical trial was done to assess antibody development to this drug [L1858], [FDA label]. Up until week 64, approximately 6.5% of subjects treated with ILUMYA 100 mg developed antibodies to tildrakizumab. Of the subjects who developed antibodies to tildrakizumab, approximately 40% (2.5% of all patients receiving ILUMYA) had antibodies that were considered neutralizing. The development of neutralizing antibodies to tildrakizumab was associated with lower serum tildrakizumab concentrations and decreased efficacy [FDA label].

The oral LD50 of potassium chloride in rats is 2600 mg/kg.[MSDS]

**Overdose information**

An overdose of potassium may result in hyperkalemia, and in some cases, death due to various causes.  Signs and symptoms of an overdose of potassium are mainly cardiovascular, neurological and musculoskeletal in nature. Arrhythmia, changes in cardiac conduction, including astystole, bradycardia, heart block, ventral fibrillation, and ventricular tachycardia may occur. In addition, hypotension may also occur along with cardiac ECG changes. Muscular weakness and respiratory muscle paralysis may occur, in addition to paresthesia. In case of an overdose, discontinue potassium administration, reduce the dose, and monitor fluid levels and electrolyte concentrations in addition to acid-base balance. Corrective therapy, such as insulin administration or potassium binding drugs, may be required. Offer supportive care and resuscitation as deemed necessary.[A186200,A186203,L8771]

**Important note regarding hyperkalemia**

 Normally, hyperkalemia is asymptomatic and only detected by laboratory testing (at values of 6.5-8.0 mEq/L) and ECG changes (peaked T- waves, lost P-waves, ST depression, and a prolonged QT interval). Muscle paralysis and cardiac arrest may occur in the advanced stages of hyperkalemia, at potassium concentrations of 9-12 mEq/L.[L8771]","**General uses of potassium**

Potassium is indicated to treat a variety of conditions. Firstly, it used to replenish potassium that has been depleted by conditions including but not limited to malabsorption, decreased intake, or excess sodium intake.  The causes of potassium deficiency are numerous. The following indications for potassium are not comprehensive, but include the main indications for which this nutrient is used. Various products and preparations contain potassium.

**Potassium chloride**

Potassium chloride is one of the main preparations of potassium used in a clinical setting. The oral solution is indicated for the prevention and treatment of hypokalemia presenting with or without metabolic alkalosis, in patients who have failed conservative management with potassium-rich foods or diuretic dose titrations.[L8744] The injection form of potassium chloride is indicated to replenish potassium in patients who are not feasible candidates for oral potassium. Highly concentrated potassium is intended for the treatment of potassium deficiency in fluid restricted individuals who cannot tolerate fluid volumes normally associated with injected potassium solutions that contain lower concentrations.[L8768]
Finally, the extended-release tablet preparation of potassium chloride is used to treat hypokalemia with or without metabolic alkalosis, to treat digitalis intoxication, and to manage patients with hypokalemic familial periodic paralysis. It is also used in the prevention of hypokalemia in those who are at a high risk of negative clinical outcomes if hypokalemia occurs; patients on digitalis or those with cardiac arrhythmias would be at particular risk of negative outcomes.[L8771]


**Potassium chloride with dextrose and sodium chloride**

DB14501,"Acute iron overdosage can be divided into four stages. In the first stage, which occurs up to six hours after ingestion, the principal symptoms are vomiting and diarrhea. Other symptoms include hypotension, tachycardia and CNS depression ranging from lethargy to coma. The second phase may occur at 6-24 hours after ingestion and is characterized by a temporary remission. In the third phase, gastrointestinal symptoms recur accompanied by shock, metabolic acidosis, coma, hepatic necrosis and jaundice, hypoglycemia, renal failure and pulmonary edema. The fourth phase may occur several weeks after ingestion and is characterized by gastrointestinal obstruction and liver damage. In a young child, 75 milligrams per kilogram is considered extremely dangerous. A dose of 30 milligrams per kilogram can lead to symptoms of toxicity. Estimates of a lethal dosage range from 180 milligrams per kilogram and upwards.

In animals, oral administration of zuranolone to pregnant rats during organogenesis resulted in developmental toxicity, including embryofetal death and fetal malformations, with a no adverse effect level (NOAEL) associated with maternal plasma exposures 7 times greater than in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 50 mg. Oral administration of zuranolone to rats during pregnancy and lactation resulted in developmental toxicity in the offspring, including, perinatal mortality, at maternal exposures similar to that in humans at the MRHD. Developmental toxicity was observed at doses that were also maternally toxic. Neuronal death was observed in rats exposed to zuranolone during a period of brain development that begins during the third trimester of pregnancy in humans and continues up to a few years after birth.[L47686]   

Zuranolone has abuse potential with associated risks of misuse, abuse, and substance use disorder including addiction. Abuse is the intentional non-therapeutic use of a drug, even once, for its desired psychological or physiological effects. Misuse is the intentional use, for therapeutic purposes, of a drug by an individual in a way other than prescribed by a health care provider or for whom it was not prescribed. Drug addiction is a cluster of behavioral, cognitive, and physiological phenomena that may include a strong desire to take the drug, difficulties in controlling drug use (e.g., continuing drug use despite harmful consequences, giving a higher priority to drug use than other activities and obligations), and possible tolerance or physical dependence. Individuals with a history of drug abuse or substance use disorders may be at a greater risk of these outcomes with zuranolone.[L47686]

In a human abuse potential study, single oral doses of 30 mg, 60 mg, and 90 mg of zuranolone (0.6 times, 1.2 times, and 1.8 times the recommended daily dose, respectively) were compared to single oral doses of alprazolam (1.5 mg and 3 mg) and placebo in healthy, non-dependent individuals with a history of recreational CNS depressant use. The study demonstrated that zuranolone has dose-dependent abuse potential comparable to alprazolam and greater abuse potential than placebo on positive subjective measures of “drug liking,” “overall drug liking,” “take drug again,” “high,” and “good drug effects.” In the human abuse potential study, dose-dependent, abuse-related adverse reactions, including euphoric mood, feeling drunk, and somnolence, were reported with zuranolone use.[L47686]

Zuranolone may produce physical dependence. Physical dependence is a state that develops as a result of physiological adaptation in response to repeated drug use, manifested by withdrawal signs and symptoms after abrupt discontinuation or a significant dose reduction of a drug.[L47686] 

Adverse reactions reported upon discontinuation of zuranolone in healthy subjects who received 50 mg of zuranolone for 5 to 7 days (on the 7th-day subjects received 50 mg or 100 mg ) included: insomnia, palpitations, decreased appetite, nightmare, nausea, hyperhidrosis, and paranoia. These adverse reactions indicate a potential for physical dependence on zuranolone. These adverse reactions were mild-to-moderate in severity.[L47686] 

The risk of developing physical dependence and a subsequent withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt zuranolone discontinuation for individuals who take a higher-than-recommended dosage and/or use zuranolone for a longer duration than recommended has not been evaluated in clinical studies. However, convulsions were observed in a dog upon abrupt zuranolone discontinuation after dogs were administered zuranolone for 14 days at doses that produced exposures higher than the maximum recommended human dose.[L47686]

There was a case of intentional overdose with zuranolone reported during premarketing clinical trials. The patient took 330 mg (6.5 times the maximum recommended dose) of zuranolone and was reported to be in an altered state of consciousness. The event resolved the next day, following treatment with intravenous fluids.[L47686]

Overdosage with zuranolone may result in excessive CNS depressant effects such as somnolence and disturbance in consciousness. There is no specific antidote for zuranolone overdosage.[L47686]

Consider contacting the Poison Help Line (1-800-222-1222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.[L47686]

Oral administration of zuranolone in a 26-week carcinogenicity study in transgenic mice (0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day), and in a 104-week carcinogenicity study in rats (0, 2, 6, or 20 mg/kg/day in males and 0, 0.2, 0.6, or 1.5 mg/kg/day in females) was not associated with increases in tumors in either species. Plasma exposures (AUC) in rats at the highest dose tested were approximately 4 times that in humans at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 50 mg.[L47686]  

Zuranolone was not genotoxic when tested in an in vitro microbial mutagenicity (Ames) assay, an in vitro chromosome aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and an in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in rats.[L47686]",Zuranolone is indicated for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD) in adults.[L47686]

The effect of vitamin A supplementation on the fetus in the setting of a reduction in maternal serum TTR caused by eplontersen administration is unknown.[L49479] 

No adverse developmental effects were observed when eplontersen or a mouse-specific surrogate was administered to mice prior to mating and continuing throughout organogenesis.[L49479] 

No dose adjustment is required in patients ≥65 years of age. In Study NCT04136184, 44 (31%) patients were 65 to 74 years of age, and 8 (5.6%) patients were ≥75 years of age.

The use of iptacopan in pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant may be considered following an assessment of the risks and benefits.

Subcutaneous administration of nedosiran (0, 2, 6, or 20 mg/kg/dose) to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis (dosing on gestation days 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19) resulted in maternal toxicity on the basis of body weight loss of up to 6.5% following the first dose in the 6 and 20 mg/kg/dose groups. Higher post-implantation loss and lower numbers of live fetuses occurred at ≥ 6 mg/kg/dose (exposures equivalent to the MRHD based on BSA), and fetal cardiovascular and skeletal malformations occurred at the 20 mg/kg/dose (2 times the MRHD based on BSA). No adverse findings were seen at the 2 mg/kg/dose, which is below the MRHD.[L48320]

In a pre-and postnatal study in mice, subcutaneous administration of nedosiran (0, 250, 500, or 1000 mg/kg/dose) or a mouse-specific (pharmacologically active) analog (10 mg/kg/dose) from implantation (dosing on gestational days 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16) to weaning (dosing on lactation days 1, 8 15, 20) did not have adverse effects on the growth, viability, development and reproductive performance of the offspring.[L48320] 

Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic risk of nedosiran have not been conducted.[L48320] 

Nedosiran was not genotoxic in the in vitro bacterial mutagenicity, in vitro micronucleus assays (human peripheral blood lymphocytes), and in vivo bone marrow micronucleus assay in mice.[L48320] 

Weekly subcutaneous administration of nedosiran at doses of 500, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg or of a mouse-specific (pharmacologically active) analog at a dose of 10 mg/kg to male mice for 4 weeks prior to and throughout mating, and to female mice for 2 weeks prior to and throughout mating and to gestation day 7 did not affect male or female fertility or early embryonic development.[L48320]

Regarding reproductive toxicity, animal studies demonstrated that oral sebetralstat administration to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused dose-related increases in external and visceral malformations (cleft palates and ventricular septal defects) and increased embryofetal losses at exposures 60 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) on an area under the curve (AUC) basis [L53533]. No fetal or maternal toxicities were observed at exposures up to 15 times the MRHD in rats or 11 times the MRHD in rabbits [L53533]. Carcinogenicity studies in rasH2-transgenic mice receiving oral doses up to 200 mg/kg/day (males) and 300 mg/kg/day (females) for 6 months demonstrated no tumorigenic potential [L53533].

Muscle weakness or fasciculations may also occur, with respiratory muscle weakness having the potential to bring fatal results. In one patient who consumed an oral daily dose of 32 mg developed bradycardia, QT prolongation, ventricular tachycardia and torsades de pointes accompanied by a brief loss of consciousness. In one patient with a history of hallucinations who consumed a daily dose of 24 mg galantamine, hallucinations requiring hospitalization occurred. A patient who ingested 160 mg of galantamine from an oral solution developed sweating, vomiting, bradycardia, and near-syncope one hour following consumption.[L51534] 

As in any case of overdose, general supportive measures should be initiated. Tertiary anticholinergics such as intravenous atropine may be used to reverse the cholinergic effects of galantamine. The recommended initial dose of atropine intravenously administered for galantamine overdose ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 mg. It is not known whether galantamine can be removed by dialysis.[L51534]",Benzgalantamine is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type.[L51534]
